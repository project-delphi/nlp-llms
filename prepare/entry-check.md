Fifteen questions in five areas, three per area, matching the prerequisites on the [home page](index.qmd#prerequisites). Allow about 15 minutes. Work on paper or in a notebook, without searching the web, and write each answer down before you open its folded key.

### Python

**E1.** What does this expression evaluate to?

```python
[x * x for x in range(5) if x % 2 == 0]
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`[0, 4, 16]`. The comprehension keeps 0, 2 and 4 and squares them.
:::

**E2.** What does this print?

```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.n = 0

    def add(self, k=1):
        self.n += k
        return self

c = Counter().add().add(3)
print(c.n)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`4`. Each call to `add` changes the same object and returns it, so the calls chain: 0 + 1 + 3.
:::

**E3.** A loop over rows read from a CSV file stops with this traceback. What is wrong, and what is the fix?

```text
  File "count.py", line 7, in <module>
    total = total + row["count"]
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`row["count"]` is a string (the CSV reader returns text), and Python will not add a string to an integer. Convert it: `total = total + int(row["count"])`. The last line of a traceback names the error; the line above it shows where it happened.
:::

### NumPy

**E4.** `A` has shape `(3, 4)` and `b` has shape `(4,)`. What are the shapes of `A + b` and `A @ b`?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`A + b` is `(3, 4)`: `b` is broadcast across the three rows. `A @ b` is `(3,)`: a matrix-vector product.
:::

**E5.** With `x = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)`, what are `x[1, :]` and `x[:, -1]`?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`x[1, :]` is `[4, 5, 6, 7]` (the second row). `x[:, -1]` is `[3, 7, 11]` (the last column).
:::

**E6.** `X` has shape `(N, d)`. Write one line that divides each row by its Euclidean length, and say why `keepdims=True` matters.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`X / np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, keepdims=True)`. With `keepdims=True` the norms have shape `(N, 1)`, which broadcasts across the `d` columns. Without it they have shape `(N,)`, which NumPy tries to align with the columns and fails (or, if `N == d`, silently divides the wrong way).
:::

### Machine-Learning Basics

**E7.** Why are hyperparameters chosen on a validation split rather than on the test split?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
Choosing on the test split makes the test score an optimistic estimate: the setting was picked because it did well on those examples. The test split is used once, after every choice is fixed. The workshop follows this rule in every lab.
:::

**E8.** Logistic regression predicts $p = \sigma(w^\top x + b)$ for a label $y \in \{0, 1\}$. Write the loss for one example, and its derivative with respect to the logit $z = w^\top x + b$.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
The cross-entropy (log loss) $\mathcal{L} = -\big[y \log p + (1 - y)\log(1 - p)\big]$. Its derivative with respect to $z$ is $p - y$: prediction minus target. The same form returns in Modules 1, 2 and 6.
:::

**E9.** Gradient descent updates $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}$. What do you expect to see if the learning rate $\eta$ is far too large?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
The loss oscillates or grows instead of falling, because each step overshoots the minimum. It can also become `nan`.
:::

### PyTorch

**E10.** Put these five lines of one training step in order.

```python
optimizer.step()
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
logits = model(x)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`optimizer.zero_grad()`, `logits = model(x)`, `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)`, `loss.backward()`, `optimizer.step()`. Putting `zero_grad()` right after `step()` instead is also correct; what matters is that gradients are cleared before the next `backward()`, because PyTorch adds to them.
:::

**E11.** What does `model.eval()` change, and what does `with torch.no_grad():` change?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
`model.eval()` switches layers whose behavior differs between training and evaluation, such as dropout (turned off) and batch normalization (uses stored statistics). It does not stop gradients. `torch.no_grad()` stops autograd from recording operations, which saves memory and time when no gradient is needed. Several labs rely on the difference: Lab 5's leak test runs in `eval()` mode.
:::

**E12.** `layer = nn.Linear(4, 3)` is applied to a tensor of shape `(8, 4)`. What is the output shape, and how many parameters does the layer have?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
Output `(8, 3)`. Parameters: a $3 \times 4$ weight matrix and 3 biases, $12 + 3 = 15$.
:::

### Mathematics

**E13.** Let $y = \sigma(z)$ with $z = wx$. What is $\dfrac{dy}{dw}$?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
By the chain rule, $\dfrac{dy}{dw} = \sigma(z)\big(1 - \sigma(z)\big)\, x$, using $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))$.
:::

**E14.** $P(A) = 0.3$ and $P(B \mid A) = 0.5$. What is $P(A \text{ and } B)$? And what is the expected value of one roll of a fair six-sided die?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(B \mid A)\,P(A) = 0.15$. The expected value is $(1 + 2 + \dots + 6)/6 = 3.5$.
:::

**E15.** A model predicts the distribution $(0.7, 0.2, 0.1)$ over three classes and the true class is the first. What is the cross-entropy, in nats? What is it for a uniform prediction over four classes? And what is the cosine similarity of the vectors $(1, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Answer"}
$-\ln 0.7 \approx 0.357$ nats. For a uniform prediction over four classes, $\ln 4 \approx 1.386$ nats: the starting loss of Lab 6's four-class classifier. The cosine is $1 / \sqrt{2} \approx 0.707$.
