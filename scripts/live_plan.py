"""Each briefing's live teaching sequence: what is taught in the room, in what order, and
for how long, including the activities (predictions, checks, the demo) that the minutes
must hold.

The plan lives in the briefing's front matter, next to the text it times:

    live:
      - {section: 1, minutes: 5}
      - {section: 2, minutes: 7, activities: [{block: chk-sdpa, minutes: 2}]}
      - {section: 6, minutes: 4, activities: [{block: demo-scaling, minutes: 4}]}

`minutes` is the exposition time of the numbered section (`## N. Title`); each activity
names a block on the page by its id (`::: {#chk-sdpa .self-check}`, `.demo`, `.predict`
or `.discuss`) and the minutes it takes in the room. Exposition and activities together
fill the module's briefing minutes exactly (45 on Day 1, 55 on Days 2 to 5).

A numbered section left out of the plan is reference material: its heading carries
`{.reference}`, and it stays on the page, styled, for reading after class.

scripts/gen_tables.py writes `_includes/live-NN.md` (the briefing's timing table) and
`_includes/pace-NN.md` (the pace sheet's briefing rows) from this; tests/test_live.py
checks it. filters/live.lua marks the planned blocks so the page shows which ones are
used in the room.
