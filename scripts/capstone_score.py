"""Lab 15's scoring as a module: the fixed cell "Scoring: do not edit" of 15-capstone.ipynb.

The block between the BEGIN and END markers below is restated verbatim in that notebook cell, and
tests/test_capstone_score.py fails if the two differ. The notebook writes `scoring_hash()` into
every submission; scripts/collect_capstone.py recomputes it from this file and refuses to compare
a submission whose hash differs. Specification: briefs/15-capstone.md, section (e); equations from
Module 15 (eq-cap-acc, eq-cap-abstain, eq-cap-unsupported, eq-cap-cost, eq-sign-test).

Standard library only, so the CI test job (PyYAML and nbformat only) can import it.

The block reads three names defined outside it, here and in the notebook: ABSTAIN (Lab 13's
abstention sentence), LOSS (briefing eq-cap-cost) and REFERENCE_JUDGE (the notebook's setup sets
it to the NLI judge, or to the stub judge offline); and the standard-library modules below.
