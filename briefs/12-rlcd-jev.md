# Lab brief: `notebooks/12-rlcd-jev.ipynb`

From the Academic Director to the two owners of Lab 12 (`AGENTS.md`, "Who owns what"): the **Neural Lab Engineer** builds Exercise 1 (the toy calibration-reward model and its training code) and the `featurize` / `ToyDecider` / `LocalDecider` cell; the **Agentic Systems Engineer** builds Exercises 2 to 4, the keyed Jev path and the stretch. Briefing: `modules/12-rlcd-jev.qmd` (same symbols and equation names: `rlhf-recall`, `outcome-objective`, `acc-reward`, `acc-optimum`, `brier-reward`, `chosen-prob`, `adapter-conf`, `three-costs`, `three-thresholds`, `three-empirical`). Lab standards: `PLAN.md` section 5. Verified Jev API surface: `briefs/jev-verification.md` (cited below as JV §n). Decision set and Lab 11 machinery: `briefs/11-calibration.md`. This file is not rendered by Quarto.

**Objectives exercised** (from `_variables.yml`, `m12`): state how RLCD's objective differs from RLHF's, and what is and is not public about it; call Jev for typed decisions; use its confidence to set action thresholds. The third objective is met with **probabilities, not the `confidence` field** (briefing section 8); a wording change is proposed at the end.

**Every time, size and cost below is an estimate or a target, not a measurement,** unless marked *checked*. *Checked* means I ran it on 2026-10-05 in the build container (CPU, Python 3.12, `torch` 2.14.1, scikit-learn 1.9.1, NumPy 2.5.3, and `typesafe-sdk` 0.7.2 loaded from the local package cache), not on Colab. No live Jev call has been made by anyone on the build: there is no key.

## The lab in one paragraph

Participants first train a small decision model on the decision set's training split twice, once with an accuracy-only reward and once with a Brier-score reward, and watch the first one's probabilities run toward 1 on the training items while the second one's stay calibrated there; on the held-out wordings of `dev` and `test` both are overconfident, and temperature scaling on `dev` closes the gap (as built; see "As built"): **our illustration, not TypeSafe's method**. They then ask a decider typed questions about every `dev` and `test` item of Workshop Desk Decisions v1: Jev through `typesafe-sdk` when a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set, otherwise a local stand-in built on the Brier-trained toy model that returns the same `SystemOneResponse` type. They draw its reliability diagram from the probability of the chosen answer, beside Lab 11's language model, and see what goes wrong if Jev's `confidence` field is used instead. Finally they derive act / ask / escalate thresholds from stated costs, analytically and from `dev`, and report the cost per case on `test`. Every checkpoint tests the participant's function on hand-made or synthetic inputs, so it gives the same verdict on both paths. No calibration result of Jev, or of any language model, is asserted.

## The honesty rule, made concrete for this notebook

`AGENTS.md` forbids presenting the toy, or any guess, as TypeSafe's method. In this notebook that means:

1. **A banner cell opens Exercise 1**, verbatim in substance: "This exercise is our illustration of what a calibration-targeted reward can do, built on the proper scoring rules of Module 11. TypeSafe has not published how RLCD works. The only statement about training we found in a TypeSafe source is: 'System One models are trained for calibrated decisions; validate their performance in the target domain' (`typesafe-ai/skills`, `SKILL.md`). Nothing in this exercise is evidence about how Jev was trained."
2. **Every plot title, table header and printed row** produced by the toy model says `toy model (our illustration)`. Every row produced by `LocalDecider` says `local toy decider (not Jev)`. The string `Jev` appears in a result label only when `JEV_PATH == "keyed"` and the row came from `TypeSafeClient`.
3. **No sentence in the notebook describes RLCD's reward, data or algorithm.** The notebook may repeat the briefing's three-column summary (TypeSafe-stated / third-party / ours) by linking to briefing section 5; it must not restate third-party claims as facts.
4. **On the no-key path**, a banner above Exercise 2's results: "No TypeSafe key: the answers below come from the workshop's toy model wrapped to look like Jev's API. They measure our toy model, not Jev. Do not quote them as Jev's."
5. **The closing cell** ("What this lab showed and what it did not", below) is part of the core path, not optional.
6. **Damani et al.'s RLCR** may be mentioned (briefing section 2, optional callout) only as published work by other authors, with the sentence "RLCR is not RLCD".

## Constraints that shape the lab

### (a) The decision set file does not exist yet

> **Out of date (as built, 2026-10-05).** The decision set exists: the template-only v1, `data/decisions_v1.jsonl.gz` (status `v1-template-only` in `data/decisions_v1_stats.json`; `train` 2,000, `dev` 100, `test` 300), built by `data/build_decisions.py`. The 80 hand-written items and the 60-item audit still need people. Lab 12 trains on the real `train` split, and its numbers are quoted in the briefing and in `data/baselines.json`, always labelled "template items only". The text below is the original constraint, kept for the record.

`data/decisions_v1.jsonl.gz` (spec: `briefs/11-calibration.md`, "Shared decision set") has not been built. Lab 12 needs the **2,000-item `train` split** to train the toy model, so a 20-item fixture (Lab 11's interim plan) is not enough here.

- The `train` split is **template-only** by design, and so are 80% of `dev` and `test`. An agent may write `data/build_decisions.py` (standard library, seeded, rule-engine labels); only the 80 hand-written items and the 60-item audit need people. **Proposal:** build and commit the template part first, flagged `provisional: true` in the file's metadata until the hand items and audit land, so Labs 11, 12 and 14 can be built and run against real template items now.
- Until then, build the notebook against `build_decisions.py`'s output in a scratch location; quote no number from it in the briefing or in `data/baselines.json`.

### (b) Lab 11's language-model results must reach Lab 12

Exercise 3 compares the decider with Lab 11's language model on the same `test` items. Colab notebooks do not share a runtime, so Lab 12 cannot read Lab 11's variables. Sources, tried in order:

1. **The participant's own Lab 11 export**: `lab11_decisions_<provider>.jsonl` in `NLP_LLMS_DATA` (or uploaded through the Files pane). Lab 11 must add a one-cell export (proposed below); fields per line: `id`, `answer`, `confidence` (stated), `valid`, `provider` (label as printed in Lab 11), `model` (provider model ID), `date`.
2. **A committed reference run**: `data/lab11_reference_decisions_v1.jsonl.gz`, the same fields, recorded once by an instructor with a key (`models.anthropic` proposed; any keyed provider is fine), registered in `_variables.yml` `datasets` with hash and size. The panel title names the model and date.
3. **Neither present**: omit the comparison panel and print why.

**Never compare against Lab 11's stub (test double).** If an export's `provider` is `stub (test double)`, refuse it with a message.

### (c) One decision interface, two backends

As JV §10. The selection runs once, at the top of Exercise 2:

```python
key = get_secret("TYPESAFE_API_KEY")          # Colab Secrets, then the environment; None if absent
JEV_PATH = "keyed" if key else "local"
if JEV_PATH == "keyed":
    JEV = AsyncTypeSafeClient(api_key=key, model=JEV_MODEL)     # never construct without a key: it raises
else:
    JEV = AsyncLocalDecider(LocalDecider(TOY_REF, featurize))  # TOY_REF: the provided Brier-trained model
```

`JEV_MODEL` repeats `models.jev` from `_variables.yml` (currently `jev-latest`; a test must fail if they disagree, as for the other model IDs). Exercises 2 to 4 never know which backend answered, except through `JEV_PATH` for labels.

**The local decider always wraps `TOY_REF`**, a Brier-reward model trained by a provided cell with the *solution* reward, not the participant's Exercise 1 model. Exercises 2 to 4 must not depend on whether Exercise 1 was finished.

## Exercise 1's model: the toy decision model (Neural Lab Engineer)

### Design requirement learned from the stand-in checks

*Stand-in measurements, made before the decision set existed. The decision-set results that replace them in the briefing are under "As built".*

The contrast the briefing promises (briefing section 2) shows cleanly **only for a low-capacity model** trained on many more items than it has parameters. *Checked* on two stand-ins:

- **Synthetic, 2 and 5 options, 2,000 train / 2,000 test items, 8 features, labels the features cannot fully determine** (`torch` linear softmax, Adam, lr 0.05, full batch, no weight penalty, seeds 0 and 1). After 3,000 steps: test accuracy within 0.011 between the two rewards; accuracy-reward model mean probability 0.968–0.986, ECE 0.176–0.299, weight norm still growing (6.5 → 11.3 → 22.8 at 300 / 1,000 / 3,000 steps for one run); Brier-reward model converged by 300 steps, ECE 0.012–0.032. Temperature fitted on 100 held-out items: τ* = 9.9–15.9 for the accuracy-reward model, after which its ECE is 0.020–0.052 and its Brier score 0.261–0.442 against the Brier-reward model's 0.256–0.423.
- **arXiv Topics, 4,096 hashed uni- and bigram features, 2,000 training papers.** The comparison flipped with the learning rate, step count and weight penalty (for example ECE 0.111 accuracy vs 0.044 Brier at lr 0.02 / 1,000 steps, but 0.130 vs 0.182 at lr 0.005 / 200 steps). Overfitting dominated. **Do not use a high-dimensional bag-of-words model.**

### Features (provided, fixed before any evaluation)

`featurize(state, question_text) -> np.ndarray of shape (31,)`, float32. It reads only the item's structured `state` and the question text, never `label`, `rule`, `rationale` or `difficulty`. It ignores a `policy` key if present (Jev's state carries the policy text; see Exercise 2).

| Group | Dims | Features |
|---|---|---|
| Numbers | 5 | `days_before / 30` clipped to [−1, 2]; `(seats − registered) / seats`; `registered / seats`; `paid_eur / 1000` (0 if no registration); `fee_eur / 1000` |
| Flags | 4 | `remote`; registration is `null`; registration `status == "confirmed"`; the request contains `@` |
| Question type | 6 | one-hot by keyword in the question: accepted (P1), full refund (P2), transfer (P3), catering (P4), approval (P5), next step (route) |
| Interactions | 5 | `days_before / 30` times each of the five policy question-type flags |
| Request keywords | 11 | lowercased request contains: ignore / override / disregard; refund / money back; transfer; cancel; how much / how many; policy / rule; register / sign up / seat; catering / parking / room / lunch; confirm; exception / manager / just this once; a question mark |

Standardize the five numeric and five interaction columns with the `train` mean and standard deviation, stored with the model. The keyword lists come from the policy text and the template vocabulary; **do not tune them on `dev` or `test` errors**. The features are deliberately unable to express the policy exactly: `days_before` enters linearly, so interval rules (P2's 50% band) and exact boundaries are approximations, and keywords are noisy proxies for intent, especially on the held-out wordings of `dev` and `test`. That is what gives the model intermediate probabilities to calibrate.

**Target, to be measured on the real `train`/`test` split:** toy test accuracy between 0.60 and 0.90 in each family, for the Brier-reward model. Outside that range, adjust the feature set once (drop the interactions if above 0.90; add `days_before` bucket flags at 7 and 14 if below 0.60), re-measure, and tell me what you changed. Freeze it before recording any number.

### Model and training (provided except the two reward functions)

```python
class ToyDecider(nn.Module):
    """Two linear heads over 31 features: policy (yes/no) and route (5 options). 224 parameters
    (31 x 2 + 2 and 31 x 5 + 5; the stored standardization buffers are not parameters)."""
    def __init__(self, d=31):
        super().__init__()
        self.policy = nn.Linear(d, 2)        # logits for ["yes", "no"]
        self.route = nn.Linear(d, 5)         # logits for ROUTE_OPTIONS, in that order
    def probs(self, feats, family):          # feats: (N, 31); family: "policy" | "route"
        head = self.policy if family == "policy" else self.route
        return torch.softmax(head(feats), dim=-1)            # (N, K)
```

- `train_toy(reward_fn, train_items, steps=3000, lr=0.05, seed=0, log_every=50)`: full batch, Adam, **no weight penalty** (a penalty would cap the accuracy reward's divergence and hide the lesson; say so in a comment). The objective is briefing @eq-outcome-objective: the mean over all 2,000 items of `reward_fn(probs, labels)`, each item through its family's head, maximized (the loss is its negative). Logs, every `log_every` steps: mean train reward, mean $\hat{p}$ on train per family, and the total weight norm. Returns `(model, log)`.
- Seeds: `torch.manual_seed(seed)` before constructing the model; CPU; deterministic.
- `TOY_REF = train_toy(reward_brier_ref, ...)` in a provided cell after Exercise 1 (see constraint (c)); `reward_brier_ref` is the solution reward under its own name, so `TOY_REF` never uses the participant's code.
- Restated from Lab 11, verbatim: `log_softmax`, `reliability_bins`, `ece`, `brier`, `brier_binary`, `noise_floor`, `fit_temperature`, `risk_coverage`, `plot_reliability`. As built, each is word for word Lab 11's solution or provided code (docstrings included), checked by `tests/test_lab12.py`, with one documented deviation: `fit_temperature` takes `log_bounds` (default Lab 11's `(-3, 3)`), because the accuracy-rewarded model's policy head needs $\tau^* \approx 29$, above $e^3$. Lab 11's `noise_floor` returns `(mean, 95th percentile)`, so Lab 12's callers take `[0]`; its `plot_reliability` takes `(conf, correct, ax, ...)`, and Lab 12 relabels the horizontal axis as the probability of the chosen answer.

### Exercise 1: participants write

```python
def reward_accuracy(probs, labels):
    """Expected correctness of an answer sampled from probs: probs[i, labels[i]].  (N,) tensor.
    Briefing eq-acc-reward: minus the linear score."""

def reward_brier(probs, labels):
    """Minus the multiclass Brier score per item: -sum_k (probs[i,k] - 1[labels[i]==k])**2.  (N,) tensor.
    Briefing eq-brier-reward."""
```

Both must be differentiable PyTorch functions (no `.item()`, no NumPy).

## Mapping decision items to Jev (Agentic Systems Engineer)

*Verified against `typesafe-sdk` 0.7.2 (JV §2), and in the build container with the cached 0.7.2 package: `Noul`, `Choice`, answer field names and types, `extra="forbid"` on questions, and response construction below.*

- **State:** `jev_state(item) = {"policy": POLICY_TEXT, **item["state"]}`, where `POLICY_TEXT` is `data/decisions_policy_v1.md`, the same text Lab 11 puts in its system prompt. Never include `label`, `rule`, `rationale`, `difficulty`, `source` or `id`.
- **Policy item → `Noul(instructions=item["question"])`**, one question per call, named `"decision"`. `criteria` omitted (yes/no is the natural reading); if you add `NoulCriteria(true=..., false=...)`, use the same words as Lab 11's prompt.
- **Route item → `Choice(instructions=item["question"], criteria=ROUTE_DESCRIPTIONS)`**, where `ROUTE_DESCRIPTIONS` is a dict over `ROUTE_OPTIONS` in order. **The descriptions must say exactly what Lab 11's prompt tells the language model about each option**, word for word, so that Exercise 3 compares the two models on the same information. Question names are not sent to the model (`SKILL.md`), so each description must be complete.
- **One item per call.** The state differs per item, and there is no batch endpoint. Run calls concurrently: `AsyncTypeSafeClient` under `asyncio.Semaphore(8)`, gathered with top-level `await` in the cell (IPython supports it on Colab). Default `RetryPolicy`. Catch `TypeSafeError` per item, record it, and continue: an item with an error is **invalid**, counted wrong in accuracy (denominator $N$, Lab 8's rule) and excluded from calibration metrics with $N_{\text{valid}}$ printed.
- **Per-item record** from `decide_all(JEV, items)`: `id`, `family`, `difficulty`, `answer`, `p` ($\hat{p}$), `probabilities` (dict), `kappa` (`confidence`, or `None` for yes/no), `correct`, `valid`, `model` (`resp.model`), `request_id`, `input_tokens` (`None` on the local path), `latency_s` (wall clock around the call), `error`.
- **Model ID:** print `resp.model` once per run and in every plot title on the keyed path. It can differ from `JEV_MODEL` (JV §2).
- **Logging:** never set the `typesafe_sdk` logger to DEBUG (request bodies are logged unredacted, JV §2).

## `LocalDecider`: the no-key backend, reusable by Labs 14 and 15

*Design from JV §10; the construction path was checked in the build container against the cached `typesafe-sdk` 0.7.2.*

```python
ROUTE_OPTIONS = ["retrieve", "calculate", "send_email", "ask_user", "escalate"]

class UnsupportedQuestion(NotImplementedError):
    """Raised for a question the toy model was not trained to answer."""

class LocalDecider:
    """No-key stand-in for typesafe_sdk.TypeSafeClient. NOT Jev: answers come from the
    workshop's toy decision model (Lab 12, Brier reward), our illustration."""
    model_name = "local-toy-decider-v1"

    def __init__(self, model: ToyDecider, featurize, *, round_to: int | None = None): ...

    def system_one(self, state, questions, *, model=None, retry=None, timeout=None,
                   extra_headers=None, extra_body=None, response_model=None) -> SystemOneResponse: ...

    def close(self): ...                       # no-op; with LocalDecider(...) as d: works
    def __enter__(self): ...
    def __exit__(self, *exc): ...

class AsyncLocalDecider:
    """Same, for code written against AsyncTypeSafeClient: `await d.system_one(...)`, `async with`."""
    def __init__(self, local: LocalDecider): ...
    async def system_one(self, state, questions, **kwargs) -> SystemOneResponse: ...
    async def close(self): ...
```

Behavior, all of which a unit check in the notebook (and later `tests/`) must pin:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `state` | a dict with `today`, `event`, `registration`, `request` (a `policy` key is accepted and ignored); anything else raises `ValueError` |
| `questions` | a non-empty mapping, values either SDK question objects or raw dicts with a `"type"` key (as the SDK accepts); each is answered independently |
| `Noul` asking one of the five policy questions (P1 to P5, recognized by `featurize`'s question keywords) | `{"type": "noul", "noul": P(yes)}` from the policy head; **no `confidence` key**, as in Jev's schema |
| any other `Noul` (for example a guard or verify question) | raise `UnsupportedQuestion(name)` (as built; the original table answered every `Noul` from the policy head) |
| `Choice` with `set(criteria) == set(ROUTE_OPTIONS)` | `{"type": "choice", "choice": argmax, "probabilities": {label: p} in the criteria's order, "confidence": κ}` with κ from briefing @eq-adapter-conf. Comment in the code: "TypeSafe's emulator formula (`system-one-adapter`); Jev's own formula is not published" |
| any other `Choice`, any `Score` | raise `UnsupportedQuestion(name)`. Labs 14 and 15 catch it and send the question to their Qwen-backed decider (JV §10) |
| probabilities | full precision, summing to 1 within 1e-6 (asserted inside); `round_to=2` rounds to 0.01 to mimic the recorded Jev response (JV §2), for testing tie handling only |
| `model` argument | ignored; the response's `model` is always `"local-toy-decider-v1"` |
| `usage` | `input_tokens=None`, `output_tokens=None`: downstream cost code prints "n/a (local)" |
| construction | `SystemOneResponse.from_http_response(httpx2.Response(200, json=body, headers={"x-typesafe-request-id": f"local-{n:06d}"}, request=httpx2.Request("POST", "local://v1/systemone")))`, or `response_model.from_http_response(...)` when given |

Two facts *checked* in the build container that force the construction row:

- `SystemOneResponse.model_validate_json(...)` builds a valid response, **but `resp.request_id` then raises `TypeSafeError("The response did not include a request ID.")`**. Any downstream cell that logs the request ID would crash on the local path. Building through `from_http_response` with an `x-typesafe-request-id` header makes `.request_id` work on both paths.
- The SDK does **not** check that `probabilities` sum to 1 (`ChoiceAnswer` accepted `{"a": 0.5, "b": 0.7}`). The local decider must assert it itself; `decide_all` checks it on the keyed path with tolerance 0.03 (five probabilities rounded to 0.01).

Deterministic: no randomness anywhere. **Labs 14 and 15 restate** `featurize`, `ToyDecider`, `train_toy`, the solution `reward_brier`, `LocalDecider` and `AsyncLocalDecider` verbatim and retrain `TOY_REF` (about 5 s on CPU, estimate from the timing below), rather than loading a file. Mark the cell "provided; reused by Labs 14 and 15". Lab 13 does not use it: its no-key reranker is a cross-encoder (JV §10).

## Core path (50 minutes)

| – | Nothing: read and answer the closing cell | – | none | – | 5 |

Minutes: 3 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 50.

**Where the slow cell goes.** On the keyed path, `decide_all` (400 calls) starts at the top of Exercise 2, before the participant writes `to_questions`; it uses the solution functions internally and says so. On the local path it takes seconds.

**Closing cell: "What this lab showed and what it did not"** (markdown, then two questions):

- Exercise 1 showed, on our toy model, that an accuracy-only reward is indifferent to probabilities and drives them toward 1, and that a proper-score reward does not, on the items the model was trained on. (As built, the notebook adds: on held-out wordings both toy models were overconfident, and temperature scaling repaired most of it.) It did not show how Jev was trained: TypeSafe has not published RLCD.
- If you ran without a key, every decider number in this notebook is our toy model's.
- With a key, Jev's calibration was measured on at most 300 `test` items of one synthetic domain; the noise floor printed beside each ECE says how much of a difference is readable. TypeSafe's own advice is to validate in the target domain.
- Questions: (1) Your guard for the `send_email` tool (Lab 14) should use higher costs for a wrong action than the router. Which threshold moves, and which way? (2) Name one thing you would need to see from TypeSafe before saying anything about how RLCD works.

## What is asserted on each path

| Path | When | Asserted | Printed, never asserted |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Keyed (Jev)** | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set | every unit checkpoint above; harness: every item yields a record (valid, or invalid with its error); each valid answer is one of the item's options; Choice probabilities sum to 1 within 0.03; `chosen_answer`'s label equals an argmax of the probabilities within 0.01 (rounding ties) | Jev's validity, accuracy, ECE, Brier, reliability diagrams, thresholds and costs per case; `resp.model`; measured tokens, USD and latency. **No Jev accuracy or calibration value is asserted, ever** |
| **Local (no key; the CI path)** | no key | the same unit and harness checks; after the Lab Engineer's recorded run, the toy model's deterministic values (accuracy, ECE, τ* per reward, the `dev`-chosen threshold pair) against `data/baselines.json` `lab12.*`, to 1e-4, as Labs 1, 2 and 11 do with their fallbacks | the same tables and plots, every label `local toy decider (not Jev)` under the honesty banner. These numbers are never written anywhere as Jev's |
| **Lab 11 comparison panel** | an export or the reference file present | the file's hash (reference) or schema (export); refusal of a stub export | the language model's diagram and metrics, labelled with its provider and model ID |

Exercise 1's qualitative claims (the accuracy-reward model's weight norm keeps growing; its `test` ECE exceeds the Brier model's) are **printed, not asserted, until verified** on the real `train` split for seeds 0 to 4. If they hold for all five, promote them to assertions with margins taken from the worst seed, and record the five seeds' values in `briefs/12-rlcd-jev.md` under "As built". If the `train` split proves linearly separable in some family (then the Brier model's weights grow too), tell me before changing the features.

## Stretch (one section, last, optional; not required by any later lab)

**Jev against an LLM on the same decisions, through TypeSafe's emulator.** `system-one-adapter==0.2.1` (TypeSafe AI, MIT; JV §5) answers the same `system_one(state, questions)` call with an LLM and returns a `SystemOneResponse` subclass with `usage.latency`.

- Install in the stretch cell only: `%pip install -q system-one-adapter==0.2.1`. Whether it resolves alongside Lab 8's `openai` and `anthropic` pins on Colab is **unverified**; check it and pin accordingly.
- Run `SystemOneAdapterClient(llm_answer_mode="probabilities", ...)` with `provider="anthropic", model=MODELS["anthropic"]` (or `"openai"`), on the 100 `dev` items with the same `jev_state` and `to_questions`. How the adapter reads provider keys is **unverified** (JV §5 read the source, did not run it): confirm and document.
- Compare on those 100 items: accuracy, binary Brier, ECE with the noise floor (about 0.07 at $N$ = 100: "a difference smaller than this is not a finding"), median and 95th-percentile latency, input and output tokens, and cost per 1,000 decisions from each provider's prices.
- Columns: Jev (keyed only), adapter LLM (needs an LLM key), `local toy decider (not Jev)` (always). Without an LLM key, print a skip message. Label the adapter column "LLM via TypeSafe's emulator", never "Jev".
- Checkpoint: all three columns return `SystemOneResponse` instances with the same answer names; probabilities sum to 1 within 0.03.

## Compute and cost budget

| Part | No key (CPU) | Keyed |
|---|---|---|
| Setup: installs (`typesafe-sdk==0.7.2`, `pydantic` as Lab 8), decision set and policy file | under 0.5 min (estimate) | the same |
| Exercise 1: two trainings of 3,000 full-batch steps on 2,000 × 31 features, plus `TOY_REF` (a third) | about 15 s (*checked*: 4.1 s and 4.4 s per 3,000-step training on random 2,000 × 31 data, build-container CPU) | the same |
| `decide_all`, 400 items | local: under 10 s (estimate) | Jev, 8 concurrent calls: under 1.5 min (estimate; latency unmeasured, third parties report 70–500 ms) |
| Exercises 3–4 (threshold search: about 5,000 pairs on 100 `dev` items) | seconds | seconds |
| **Core path total** | **under 2 min** (estimate) | **under 3 min** (estimate) |
| Stretch: 100 adapter LLM calls, 8 concurrent | skipped | under 2 min (estimate) |

**Cost note** (state in the notebook; estimates from token arithmetic, **not measured invoices**; replace with figures measured from `usage` on a real run):

- **Jev, core path:** 400 calls × about 1,000 input tokens (the policy, about 700 tokens; records and request, about 200; question and option descriptions, about 50–100) ≈ 0.4M input tokens. At 0.042 USD per million input tokens and 0 for output (`WorkflowEvals` price table for `typesafe:jev-1.13.0`, TypeSafe-published, not the pricing page; output "currently free" per the SDK schema), about **0.02 USD: state "under 5 cents"**. The recorded example in JV §2 (448 input tokens for one state and three short questions) is consistent with this order of magnitude.
- **Stretch, adapter LLM on 100 items:** about 110k input tokens and up to 15k output tokens. Anthropic `models.anthropic` at 1 / 5 USD per million (Anthropic's pricing page, read 2026-10-05 for Lab 8): about 0.11 + 0.08 USD, state **"under 25 cents"**. OpenAI `models.openai` at 0.10 / 0.50 USD per million (secondary sources, per Lab 8's brief): state **"under 5 cents"**.
- **Local path:** free.
- A room of about 30 people on one shared key is about 12,000 Jev calls in a few minutes. Rate limits are **unknown** (JV §9). Ask TypeSafe about workshop keys (`PLAN.md` section 6, "Jev access").

## Flags for the Lab Engineers

1. **Names.** Use the briefing's: `p_hat` or `p` for $\hat{p}$, `correct` for $o$, `kappa` for Jev's `confidence`, `tau_esc` / `tau_act`, `costs = dict(wrong=..., ask=..., miss=..., esc=...)`. Do not name anything `lambda` or `T`.
2. **Never read `confidence` for calibration.** Reliability diagrams, ECE, Brier and thresholds use $\hat{p}$ from @eq-chosen-prob. `kappa` appears only in Exercise 3's redraw and in the records.
3. **Tie rule for yes/no:** "yes" when `noul >= 0.5`. State it in the notebook.
4. **Fit on `dev`, report on `test`**, for temperature and for thresholds, as in Lab 11. `train` is never shown to Jev or to an LLM.
5. **Do not send personal data** in `state`; the decision set has none by construction (invented names, `example.org`). Do not log at DEBUG.
6. **Never construct `TypeSafeClient` or `AsyncTypeSafeClient` without a key**; it raises at construction (JV §2).
7. **Package names.** Install only `typesafe-sdk==0.7.2` (and, in the stretch, `system-one-adapter==0.2.1`). `tests/test_package_names.py` fails on lookalikes; never print an unregistered name (JV §6).
8. **Rounded probabilities.** Jev's may arrive rounded to 0.01 (JV §2). Lab 11's `risk_coverage` already treats ties as one step; `choose_thresholds` must search over unique values.
9. **Invalid answers** count wrong in accuracy and are excluded from calibration metrics, with $N_{\text{valid}}$ printed (Lab 11, flag 5).
10. **The local path is the CI path.** `scripts/test_notebooks.py` runs it with no key; it must finish without network access to `api.typesafe.ai`.
11. **Report back:** the measured toy-model tables for both rewards and seeds 0–4; whether the feature set needed adjusting; run time per section on CPU (and on Colab); whether the keyed path ran, with `resp.model`, measured tokens, cost and latency; whether the stretch ran; anything in the briefing that the notebook contradicts.

## Proposed changes (not made; for Romeo or the Architect)

- **`_variables.yml` `modules.m12.objectives[2]`:** "Use its confidence to set action thresholds" → "Turn its probabilities into act, ask and escalate thresholds from stated costs". Reason: briefing section 8; the `confidence` field must not be used for thresholds.
- **`_variables.yml` `datasets`, new entry `lab11_reference`** for `data/lab11_reference_decisions_v1.jsonl.gz` (modules `[11, 12]`, hash and size on recording, `license: "CC0 1.0"`, plus `model` and `recorded` date fields).
- **`data/baselines.json`:** `lab12.toy.{accuracy,brier}.{dev,test}` (accuracy, mean $\hat{p}$, ECE, Brier, τ*) and `lab12.local_thresholds` after the recorded run.
- **Lab 11 (brief and notebook):** an export cell writing `lab11_decisions_<provider>.jsonl` with the fields of constraint (b); and `ROUTE_DESCRIPTIONS` defined once in Lab 11's prompt so Lab 12 can restate it verbatim.
- **`data/build_decisions.py`:** build and commit the template items first, marked provisional (constraint (a)).
- **`PLAN.md` section 4, Module 12, Briefing:** "typed answers (choice, score, yes/no) with confidence out" → "typed answers (yes/no, choice, score) with probabilities out (plus a concentration `confidence` for choice and score)"; "turning confidence into policy" → "turning probabilities into policy". **Readings:** "TypeSafe's public RLCD and Jev announcement and API documentation" → "TypeSafe's Jev announcement and `docs.typesafe.ai` (not yet read; see the TODO in Module 12); `typesafe-ai/skills` `SKILL.md`; Gneiting and Raftery 2007; Damani et al. 2026 (RLCR: related published work, not TypeSafe's); Kahneman 2011 for the framing".
- **`PLAN.md` section 6, new row.** Item: "Lab 12 compares with Lab 11's LLM". Risk: "Colab notebooks share no runtime, so Lab 12 cannot see Lab 11's results". Mitigation: "Lab 11 exports its records; an instructor-recorded reference run is committed; Lab 12 omits the panel rather than compare with a stub".
- **`PLAN.md` section 6, RLCD rows:** add "Module 12 carries a TODO for Romeo to quote TypeSafe's announcement and docs; until then it lists only the `SKILL.md` sentence as TypeSafe-stated".
- **`PLAN.md` section 7, Day 8:** tick "Draft briefing 12: RLCD and Jev (public facts and our illustration clearly separated)", with the note "(TypeSafe's own statements are a marked TODO for Romeo; not rendered)".
- **`references.qmd`:** under Module 12, add `SKILL.md` and `typesafe-sdk`, Gneiting and Raftery 2007, Damani et al. 2026, Kahneman 2011, Stanovich and West 2000, and Melnikoff and Bargh 2018; mark TypeSafe's announcement and docs as "to be read".
- **`tests/`:** a unit test for `LocalDecider` once it lives in a module the tests can import (or a notebook-cell test in `test_notebooks.py`): the behavior table above.

## As built (review of 2026-10-05)

The Academic Director reviewed `notebooks/12-rlcd-jev.ipynb` against this brief and Module 12, following the Module 1 review pattern. Everything below was *checked* in the build container (CPU, `scripts/test_notebooks.py 12-rlcd-jev` and a scratch nbclient run of the same notebook with no key), not on Colab. No Jev call was made; the keyed path and the stretch's LLM column did not run.

**Toy model on the decision set (template items only; `data/baselines.json`, `lab12.toy.*`; our toy model, not Jev).** Seed 0, 3,000 full-batch Adam steps, lr 0.05, no weight penalty:

| | Accuracy reward | Brier reward |
|---|---|---|
| `train`: accuracy, mean $\hat{p}$, ECE | 0.865, 0.993, 0.133 | 0.874, 0.876, 0.027 |
| Weight norm at steps 1,500 and 3,000 | 71.9, 110.6 | 50.2, 74.7 |
| `test`: accuracy, mean $\hat{p}$, ECE, binary Brier | 0.677, 0.985, 0.308, 0.306 | 0.687, 0.891, 0.258, 0.281 |
| $\tau^*$ on `dev` (policy, route) | 28.88, 8.06 | 3.12, 7.43 |
| `test` after temperature: ECE, binary Brier | 0.155, 0.236 | 0.178, 0.241 |

Seeds 0 to 4 (`settings.seed_check` in both entries, measured with a scratch restatement of the notebook's code; seed 0 agrees with the notebook to the third decimal):

| Seed | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `test` ECE, accuracy reward | 0.308 | 0.310 | 0.310 | 0.309 | 0.309 |
| `test` ECE, Brier reward | 0.258 | 0.254 | 0.259 | 0.258 | 0.257 |
| `test` accuracy, accuracy reward | 0.677 | 0.680 | 0.683 | 0.683 | 0.677 |
| `test` accuracy, Brier reward | 0.687 | 0.693 | 0.700 | 0.697 | 0.687 |
| `train` ECE, accuracy reward | 0.133 | 0.132 | 0.129 | 0.129 | 0.133 |
| `train` ECE, Brier reward | 0.027 | 0.027 | 0.030 | 0.027 | 0.029 |
| Weight norm at step 3,000, accuracy reward | 110.6 | 112.1 | 116.1 | 112.5 | 113.4 |
| Weight norm at step 3,000, Brier reward | 74.7 | 74.2 | 78.9 | 72.0 | 79.3 |
| $\tau^*$ on `dev`, policy head, accuracy reward | 28.877 | 28.909 | 29.997 | 29.104 | 30.355 |
| $\tau^*$ on `dev`, policy head, Brier reward | 3.115 | 3.294 | 3.117 | 2.940 | 3.305 |

What this changes in the brief and the briefing:

- **The Brier curve does not flatten.** Both weight norms keep growing; the Brier model's more slowly. Some groups of training items are separable by the features (the case flagged at the end of "What is asserted on each path"), so even the proper reward pushes their probabilities toward 0 and 1. Checked by the Director on `TOY_REF` (seed 0): 405 of the 1,000 `train` route items get $\hat{p} > 0.999$, all of them right; 150 of the 1,000 policy items get $\hat{p} > 0.99999$, 98.7% right. The features were not changed. The notebook asserts the rate difference (accuracy model's norm above the Brier model's by more than 15 at step 3,000), not growth against no growth.
- **The clean contrast is in distribution.** On `train` the Brier model's mean $\hat{p}$ sits on its accuracy and its ECE is a fifth of the accuracy model's. On the held-out wordings of `dev` and `test` both models are overconfident; the Brier model less so on every seed.
- **Temperature scaling closes the gap.** After one temperature per head on `dev`, the accuracy-rewarded model is no worse than the Brier one on `test` (differences below the noise floor of about 0.06). The briefing's former "its Brier score stayed slightly worse" (a stand-in result) is dropped.
- **Feature set:** the Brier model's `test` accuracy is 0.740 (policy) and 0.633 (route), inside the 0.60–0.90 design range; no adjustment was needed.

**Local thresholds (`lab12.local_thresholds`; local toy decider, not Jev).** Costs `wrong=20, ask=0.5, miss=4, esc=3`. Analytic pair $(0.375, 0.969)$; `dev`-chosen pair $(0, 0.9999993)$, printed as $(0.000, 1.000)$. The chosen $\tau_{\text{act}}$ is the 11th-largest `dev` probability (float32 softmax saturates: five `dev` answers have $\hat{p} = 1.0$), so the rule acts on the 11 most confident `dev` answers (all right), asks about the other 89 and never escalates. On `test` it asks about 88% and acts on 12% (36 items, 2 of them wrong), at 1.800 per case, against 1.753 ask-all, 3.0 escalate-all, 6.267 act-all, 5.517 Chow and 4.302 at the analytic pair (which acts on 56%). Reason: no top slice of `dev` larger than those 11 is right 96.9% of the time (the 54 answers with $\hat{p} \ge 0.969$ are right 74% of the time), and no bottom slice is mostly wrong (the five least confident are right 60% of the time; no $\hat{p}$ is below 0.375). The briefing's section 3 now states and explains this result.

**Deviations from this brief, accepted:**

- *Recorded values* are asserted with room for about two items to flip across machines: `atol=0.015` for accuracy, mean $\hat{p}$, ECE and binary Brier on six reward/split/family rows, 0.02 for the `dev`-chosen pair and 0.07 for its `test` cost. The first CI run on a GitHub runner flipped one of the 150 policy test items (accuracy 0.7467 against 0.7400), which the earlier 5e-3 did not allow. $\tau^*$ is recorded, not asserted.
- *Exercise 1's qualitative claims* are asserted (as this brief allowed after five seeds held), with margins of at most half the smallest seed margin: accuracy-model weight growth from step 1,500 to 3,000 above 15; its norm above the Brier model's by 15; its `train` mean $\hat{p}$ above 0.98; Brier `train` $|\hat{p} - \text{accuracy}| < 0.02$; `train` ECE gap above 0.05; `test` ECE gap above 0.025.
- *`LocalDecider`* answers a `Noul` only when it is one of the five policy questions; any other `Noul` raises `UnsupportedQuestion` (behavior table above, amended). Labs 14 and 15 must catch it for guard and verify questions.
- *Constraint (b)*: the Lab 11 export exists (Lab 11 cell `ex4-export`, fields `id, split, family, answer, confidence, valid, label, provider, model, date`; Lab 12 checks all ten). The committed reference run `data/lab11_reference_decisions_v1.jsonl.gz` does not exist and Lab 12 does not look for it; without an export the decider is drawn alone.
- *Timing*: the notebook headed Setup "(3 minutes)" and Exercise 0 "(3 minutes)" (53 in all); Setup is now headed "counted in Exercise 0's 3 minutes", so the core path is 3 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 50. Lab 11 has the same double count (Setup 3 and Exercise 0 3); not changed here.
- *Run time (CPU, build container, no key):* the whole notebook including the stretch's local column runs in 21 to 28 s; the two Exercise 1 trainings take about 12.6 s. Colab not measured.

**Proposed changes, status:** `_variables.yml` objective 3 reworded (done); `data/baselines.json` `lab12.*` entries (done); Lab 11 export cell and `ROUTE_DESCRIPTIONS` (done; Lab 12's copy is checked against `build_decisions.route_descriptions()`); template part of `build_decisions.py` (done); `lab11_reference` dataset entry, `PLAN.md` section 4 wording, section 6 rows and `references.qmd` (not done; not touched by this review, which was told not to edit `PLAN.md` or `_variables.yml`).

## Not verified by the Director

- **Superseded (2026-10-05):** "Nothing in this lab has been built or run. No notebook exists. The decision set does not exist." The notebook and the template-only decision set now exist; see "As built" for what was run and what was not. The toy-model numbers in "Design requirement learned from the stand-in checks" are still stand-in numbers; the decision-set numbers are under "As built".
- **No live Jev call.** Jev's accuracy, calibration, latency, rate limits, rounding, current model behind `jev-latest`, and the server's `confidence` formula are unknown. The local-path construction was checked offline against the cached `typesafe-sdk` 0.7.2 only.
- **TypeSafe's documentation and announcement are unread** (blocked from the build container on 2026-10-05, again by WebFetch today for `typesafe.ai`). Everything the briefing says TypeSafe stated comes from the SDK, `SKILL.md`, `system-one-adapter` and `WorkflowEvals` via `briefs/jev-verification.md`.
- **Third-party RLCD claims** were seen only in web-search summaries; the pages themselves were blocked.
- `system-one-adapter`'s key handling and its compatibility with Lab 8's pins are unverified.
- Prices: Jev's from TypeSafe's eval price table, not its pricing page; OpenAI's from secondary sources.
- Citations: Damani et al. (2026) checked by web search (title, ICLR 2026, abstract), not against the paper; the author list is from memory. Kahneman 2011, Stanovich and West 2000, Melnikoff and Bargh 2018 and Chow 1970 are cited from memory.
- `quarto render` was not run: Quarto is not installed in the build container.
