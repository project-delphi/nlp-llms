# Lab brief: `notebooks/02-word-vectors.ipynb`

**From:** Academic Director. **To:** Neural Lab Engineer. **Briefing:** `modules/02-word-vectors.qmd` (equation labels below refer to it).
**Status:** the notebook is built and was run locally on CPU (not on Colab). The numbers in the sections below are the original targets and estimates; the measured values and the deviations are in "As built" at the end.

## Purpose

Participants write the skip-gram negative-sampling (SGNS) loss, train embeddings, inspect them, and then **replace Lab 1's TF-IDF features with averaged embeddings on the same classification split, reporting the same metrics (accuracy and macro-F1 on the test split)**. The lab must show the two rows side by side and report the result whichever way it falls. Do not tune until embeddings win; the briefing tells participants this is an empirical question.

## Data

- **Classification:** the topic-classification set from Lab 1 (arXiv Topics v1, `data/README.md`), with the identical train/validation/test split, tokenizer and vocabulary rule. Import or copy Lab 1's loader and seed; do not re-split. Refer to the dataset generically in prose so a license-driven swap does not force a rewrite.
- **Embedding corpus:** the text of that set's **training split only**, labels ignored. Reasons: it is in-domain for the classifier, it needs no second download or license, and it keeps the test split unseen. If Lab 1 subsamples the training split for its classifier, embeddings may still use the full training text, but the classifier must use Lab 1's subset.
- **Not** the LM corpus from Labs 1 and 3: at roughly 0.2M words in an archaic register it is too small for sensible neighbors and is out of domain.
- **Risk to measure (unverified):** I estimate the training text at a few million tokens, which should give sensible neighbors for frequent domain words (methods, tasks, sensors) and mostly wrong analogies. Measure token count, vocabulary size, pairs per epoch and seconds per epoch on a T4 before fixing hyperparameters. If neighbors are poor within the budget, report it; do not hide it with a cherry-picked word list. Fallback options to raise with the coordinator: more epochs with a smaller vocabulary, or a larger license-clean corpus.

## Provided (participants do not write)

Setup and seeds; data loading; `make_pairs` (windowing, with frequent-word subsampling); `noise_distribution` (@eq-noise); negative sampler; `SkipGram` module (`E`, `U` as in the briefing's refresher code); both training loops; `analogy` (@eq-analogy); the PCA plot; the TF-IDF + logistic regression baseline, recomputed in a cell so the notebook runs cold without Lab 1's outputs; the results table.

Suggested starting hyperparameters, to be confirmed by measurement: $d = 100$, window half-width $m = 5$, $K = 5$, vocabulary capped near 20,000 by minimum count, large batches (several thousand pairs), Adam.

## Core path (50 minutes)

Each exercise follows Predict, Run, Explain, Check, as a `# TODO N` stub with a folded solution.

| # | Participant writes | Equation | Checkpoint (assertion) and metric | Min |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| – | Setup, load data, read three sample (center, context) pairs | | Printed corpus statistics | 4 |
| 1 | `sgns_loss(e_center, u_context, u_negatives)` with shapes `(B, d)`, `(B, d)`, `(B, K, d)`, returning the batch mean | @eq-sgns | (a) all-zero inputs give exactly $(K+1)\log 2$; (b) matches a reference value on a fixed seeded batch; (c) autograd gradient with respect to `e_center` equals @eq-sgns-grad. **Metric:** training loss, which must fall below its initial value of about $(K+1)\log 2$ | 12 |
| – | Run the provided training loop; predict what the loss curve looks like | | Loss curve; assertion that final loss is below the initial loss | 4 |
| 2 | `nearest_neighbors(word, E, k)` by cosine similarity, excluding the query word | @eq-cosine | Toy 5-word matrix with a known answer; similarities sorted descending; query excluded. **Metric:** printed neighbors for a fixed probe list, plus the share of probe words whose top-10 contains a listed expected neighbor (printed, not asserted, until the engineer has measured its variance across seeds) | 7 |
| – | Run `analogy` on a provided list; view the PCA plot; explain one failure | @eq-analogy | Printed analogy accuracy on the provided list. Expected to be low; say so | 5 |
| 3 | `average_embeddings(token_ids, mask, E)` returning `(N, d)` | @eq-avg | Padding does not change the result (same document with and without padding); a document of only padding gives the zero vector, not NaN; output shape | 6 |
| 4 | `FeedForwardClassifier.forward` (one hidden ReLU layer, returns logits) | @eq-ffn | Logits shape `(B, C)`; provided cell checks autograd's $\partial\mathcal{L}/\partial z$ against $\hat{y} - \mathrm{onehot}(y)$ (@eq-backprop). **Metric:** test accuracy and macro-F1 after the provided training loop, with an assertion that accuracy clears a floor the engineer sets from measured runs (well above the majority-class rate, with margin for seed variance) | 8 |
| – | Results table: TF-IDF + logistic regression against averaged SGNS embeddings + feed-forward network, same test split, accuracy and macro-F1; one-sentence explanation of the gap | | Table printed; both rows computed in this notebook | 4 |

Embeddings are **frozen** in the classifier on the core path, so the comparison isolates the features. Do not add a fine-tuning variant to the core path.

## Stretch (optional, last, not required by any later lab)

**Pretrained GloVe comparison.** Load a small pretrained GloVe set (50 or 100 dimensions), restrict it to the lab vocabulary, and rerun three things with it: neighbors for the probe list, the analogy list, and the Exercise 3 and 4 classifier. Add a third row to the results table and report vocabulary coverage. Point to draw out: the same method trained on billions of tokens gives much better analogies, which is a statement about data, not about the objective. To confirm before building: download size and time on Colab, the license of the vectors, and a pinned source with a fallback.

## Run time

Target, not measured: under 10 minutes of compute cold on a free Colab T4 for the core path, of which about 3 minutes for SGNS training and under 1 minute for the classifier. The engineer reports the measured figures, and the measured CPU time if the T4 is unavailable.

## Coordination and open questions

1. Lab 1 must expose its split, tokenizer and vocabulary in a form Lab 2 can reuse exactly; Lab 6 reuses the same split and metrics again.
2. The Exercise 1 function signature above is the one shown in the briefing's refresher code. If it changes, tell the Academic Director so the briefing changes too.
3. The briefing's equation-to-lab table uses the function names in this brief: `sgns_loss`, `nearest_neighbors`, `average_embeddings`, `FeedForwardClassifier`, `noise_distribution`, `analogy`.
4. The briefing has a placeholder for a PCA figure to be produced from this lab's trained embeddings; save the plotted words and coordinates.
5. If 50 minutes proves too tight in a dry run, cut the analogy step to a demonstration cell first; Exercises 1, 3 and 4 and the results table are the part the module objectives require.

## As built (Director review, 2026-10-05)

The notebook departs from this brief in these ways. All are accepted; the briefing now matches the notebook.

- **Exercise 2:** `nearest_neighbors(query, E, k=10, exclude=(), words=None)`. `query` is a word or a vector, so `analogy` can reuse it; `exclude` and `words` serve the analogy and the toy checkpoint. The scaffold handles the lookup and the excluded set; participants write the cosine, the masking and the top-k.
- **Analogies:** `analogy(a, b, a2, E)`, provided, built on `nearest_neighbors`.
- **Exercise 1 checkpoint:** a hand-computed two-pair batch replaces "a reference value on a fixed seeded batch", and a large-score case checks that the loss stays finite. The gradient check covers all three lines of @eq-sgns-grad.
- **Exercise 2 metric:** the neighbor hit rate is asserted (at least 0.5), not only printed, after the engineer measured 0.72 to 0.83 across seeds.
- **Exercise 3:** `average_embeddings(token_ids, mask, E)`, with an explicit mask, as specified.
- **SkipGram:** adds word2vec's initialization, $E \sim \mathcal{U}(-0.5/d, 0.5/d)$ and $U = 0$, so the first loss is exactly $(K + 1)\log 2$; the training cell asserts it. The briefing's refresher code now shows it.
- **Pair pipeline:** `make_pairs` adds word2vec's dynamic window and keeps windows inside one abstract; subsampling uses $\tau = 10^{-3}$. The briefing's optional box now states both.
- **Hyperparameters as run:** $d = 100$, $m = 5$, $K = 5$, 3 epochs, batch 16,384 pairs, Adam with learning rate $10^{-2}$; classifier hidden size 256, 30 epochs, best epoch chosen on validation macro-F1. The vocabulary is Lab 1's (`min_df = 2`, 12,469 words), not a separate cap near 20,000, so TF-IDF and the embeddings share one vocabulary.
- **PCA groups:** Vision, Language, Robotics and Numbers (the brief's examples were left over from an earlier dataset). The figure in the briefing is drawn from the run's saved coordinates, `images/02-embedding-pca.csv`, by `scripts/make_figures_02.py`.

Measured (`data/baselines.json`, CPU, 2 PyTorch threads on a shared machine): embedding corpus 1,091,692 tokens, 4.31 million pairs per epoch, SGNS training 695 s, loss 4.159 at the first step and 2.342 over the last 50 steps. Neighbor hit rate 0.72, analogy accuracy 0.20 (4 of 20). Test accuracy and macro-F1: TF-IDF + logistic regression 0.884 / 0.884; averaged SGNS + feed-forward 0.867 / 0.867 (0.864 to 0.872 over four runs); stretch, averaged GloVe 0.805 / 0.805, with 92% vocabulary coverage, neighbor hit rate 0.61 and 11 of 19 analogies.

The exercise minutes in the core-path table sum to 50 (4 + 12 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 4). There is one stretch section, placed last.

## Not verified by the Director

- The notebook was not re-executed for this review; it was checked by reading its source against the briefing and `data/baselines.json`.
- Run time on Colab, on either a CPU or a T4 runtime. SGNS training took 695 s on the shared CPU, so a cold Colab CPU run may exceed the 10-minute target; the T4 time is unknown.
- The notebook's statement that two principal components keep about a fifth of the variance of the 60 plotted vectors: the saved CSV holds only the coordinates.
