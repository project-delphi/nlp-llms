# PLAN.md — From Traditional NLP to Modern LLMs

A 5-day intensive workshop by Genial Labs. This file is the master plan: curriculum, repository design, lab standards, and the build checklist. Agent personas for the build are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

**Status (2026-10-06):** what has run, where, and the blocking work that remains are generated from evidence on the [readiness page](https://project-delphi.github.io/nlp-llms/readiness.html) (`_includes/readiness.md`, built from the readiness fields in `_variables.yml` and the run records in `runs/`); this paragraph no longer restates them. All 15 briefings and 16 notebooks are written. No lab has been run on Colab. A five-day revision was approved on 2026-10-06 and is being built in six phases (section 8). Earlier status, kept for the record: Labs 01–05 were run end to end on CPU only, and Labs 06–15 on their offline paths, because the build container had no Hub access and no API keys; Lab 14's open path was later run on an Apple laptop (263 s). This plan is a living document.

## 1. Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Title** | From Traditional NLP to Modern LLMs: n-grams, attention, RLHF, RLCD and agents |
| **Length** | 5 days, 09:00–17:00, 15 modules (the capstone fills two module slots on Day 5), plus Module 0 as optional pre-work, with an optional drop-in clinic on Day 1, 08:00–09:00 |
| **Module shape** | Two clocks (`schedule.clocks` in `_variables.yml`). **Day 1:** four 95-minute modules, each 45 min briefing then 50 min Colab lab. **Days 2–5:** three 120-minute modules a day, each 55 min briefing (about 45 of exposition and 10 of scheduled predictions, checks and the demo), a 55 min lab (the 50-minute core path plus 5 minutes of slack for setup and downloads) and a 10 min debrief; the middle module's briefing is before lunch and its lab and debrief after. Days 2–5 open with 15 minutes of warm-up and close with 15 of wrap-up. Module 0 is pre-work, planned at 60 minutes, with no briefing and no notebook |
| **Audience** | ML practitioners: comfortable with Python, NumPy and basic ML, some PyTorch |
| **Site** | Quarto website, deployed to GitHub Pages |
| **Labs** | Google Colab notebooks, free-tier T4 runtime |
| **Structural model** | [`project-delphi/tensors-workshop`](https://github.com/project-delphi/tensors-workshop/) |
| **Licence** | CC BY 4.0 for teaching content, MIT for code |

### The five days

| Day | Theme | Modules | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before Day 1 | Pre-work (optional) | 0 | |
| 1 | Foundations: from counts to attention | 1–4 | How do we turn text into something a model can learn from? |
| 2 | Transformers and pretrained models | 5–7 | How does one architecture, pretrained at scale, become a general tool? |
| 3 | Using and aligning LLMs | 8–10 | How do we use these models, and what are they trained to want? |
| 4 | Calibration, decisions and retrieval | 11–13 | When should a model's answer be trusted, and how do we ground it in sources? |
| 5 | Agents and the capstone | 14–15 | How do we build reliable systems out of these models? |

### Prerequisites

- Python: functions, classes, comprehensions, reading a traceback.
- NumPy: broadcasting, indexing, matrix products.
- ML basics: train/validation/test splits, loss functions, gradient descent, logistic regression.
- PyTorch: has trained at least one model with `nn.Module` and an optimizer loop. Module 2 includes a short refresher.
- Maths: vectors, matrices, the chain rule, basic probability (conditional probability, expectation, cross-entropy).
- A Google account for Colab. API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic and TypeSafe are optional: every API lab has a free open-model path.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop a participant can:

1. Explain the line of ideas from count-based language models to transformers, and say what problem each step solved.
2. Implement the core of each model in PyTorch: skip-gram with negative sampling, an LSTM language model, seq2seq with attention, and a small GPT.
3. Use the Hugging Face stack to tokenise, load, fine-tune and evaluate pretrained models, including LoRA.
4. Use the OpenAI and Claude APIs for prompting, structured output and tool use, and compare them on the same task.
5. Explain RLHF end to end (preference data, reward model, policy optimisation, DPO), train a toy version, and name its failure modes.
6. Measure calibration (reliability diagrams, ECE, proper scoring rules), explain how RLCD's objective differs from RLHF's, and use a calibrated decision model (Jev) through its API.
7. Build and evaluate a RAG pipeline with LlamaIndex and LangChain.
8. Build a LangGraph agent with tools, state, human-in-the-loop checkpoints and confidence-gated control using Jev.
9. Combine these into one system, evaluate it, and report accuracy, abstention and cost.

### Pedagogical principles

Drawn from Stanford CS224N, CMU CS 11-747 and MIT 6.S191:

- **Derive, implement, then use the library.** Each idea is first motivated by the failure of the previous one, then derived briefly, then built, and only then used through a library (CS224N).
- **Code-first neural modelling.** Briefings show the model as code alongside the equations; every equation in a briefing maps to a named line in the lab (CMU 11-747).
- **Short briefing, immediate lab.** No briefing runs longer than 45 minutes on Day 1, or 55 on Days 2–5 (which include about 10 minutes of scheduled activities), before hands-on work (MIT 6.S191).
- **Predict → Run → Explain → Check.** The lab rhythm carried over from `tensors-workshop`: participants predict an output, run the cell, explain the result, then pass a checkpoint assertion.
- **One running thread.** The same small datasets and the same tasks reappear across modules, so improvements are measured, not asserted.
- **Retrieve and manipulate before the lab.** Each briefing opens with a recap box, closes most sections with a check-yourself question (answer folded), carries its derivations through a worked numeric example, and has at most one interactive demo. Check-yourself questions and demos sit outside the 45 minutes; recaps and worked examples are counted inside them. (The five-day revision brings a few checks and the demo inside the budget: section 8, Phase 4.) Authoring hooks: `.recap`, `.self-check`, `.worked-example`, `.demo` (styled in `custom.scss`; `filters/pedagogy.lua` styles the per-section objective lines).
- **Honesty about what is known.** Where a method is unpublished (RLCD), the material says so and separates public facts from our own illustration.

### Conventions copied from `tensors-workshop`

- **One ID per module.** `NN-kebab-slug` is the same for the module page, the notebook and the `_variables.yml` key (`m00` … `m15`). Module 0 has `notebook: false`: a module page but no notebook.
- **`_variables.yml` is the single source of truth.** Each module entry holds `n`, `slug`, `day` (0 for pre-work), `minutes` (a test checks it equals what the day's clock gives the module), `title`, `summary`, `objectives`, `stack`. Each day names its clock (`days.dN.clock`). Pages read it with `{{< var modules.m01.title >}}`; the generator scripts read it too. Model IDs and package pins also live here, so a version bump is a one-line change.
- **Generated files are never edited by hand.** `scripts/gen_tables.py` writes the tables in `_includes/` and the marked regions in `README.md`. `scripts/gen_notebooks.py` owns the first cell (title, Colab badge, time, objectives) and the last cell (next notebook, site link) of every notebook, strips outputs and execution counts, and is idempotent. CI fails if running the generators changes anything.
- **Notebooks are not executed at render time.** `_quarto.yml` lists pages explicitly under `render:` and ships `notebooks/*.ipynb` as `resources:`. There is no `_freeze/`.
- **Deploy from an Actions artifact.** `publish.yml` renders to `docs/`, which is gitignored, and deploys with `actions/deploy-pages`.
- **A mirror at Genial Labs.** `genial-labs-ai/nlp-llms` is a plain copy kept equal to `main` by its `mirror.yml` (a fast-forward from here every four hours, then a `publish.yml` dispatch). It renders with the `genial-labs` profile (`_quarto-genial-labs.yml`), so its site-url is <https://genial-labs-ai.github.io/nlp-llms/>, and it skips the notebook, browser and health jobs. (Added 2026-10-07.)
- **Navbar, plus a module sidebar on module pages.** Navbar: Home, Schedule, Days (dropdown: Module 0 as pre-work, then Days 1–5), Notebooks, Setup, References, Teach, FAQ. Inside `modules/` a generated left sidebar (`_includes/sidebar.yml`) lists Module 0 as pre-work, then the modules by day, with previous/next module links at the foot of each page. (Changed 2026-10-05; `tensors-workshop` has no sidebar.)

### Deliberately left out of v1

Spanish translation of every page, 3D interactive widgets, Kahoot quizzes, the NotebookLM companion, Playwright navigation tests and revealjs slide decks for the briefings. Each can be added after v1.0 without changing the structure above. (The one deck in v1 is `welcome.qmd`, the ten-minute opening of Day 1, added 2026-10-07; its timetable and day slides are generated from `_variables.yml`.)

## 4. Curriculum

Each module lists objectives, the briefing outline, the lab, and key readings. Lab names are the notebook file names under `notebooks/`. Every lab has a core path that fits 50 minutes and one optional stretch section (see section 5).

### Before Day 1 — Pre-work

#### Module 0 · Coding agents in the terminal (optional pre-work; drop-in clinic on Day 1, 08:00–09:00)

- **Objectives:** install and drive a terminal coding agent; build and check two small data apps with it; publish them with GitHub and GitHub Pages.
- **Format:** pre-work: the sections are planned at 60 minutes, and the estimate is about 90 with one-time setup (WSL 2, the Command Line Tools, an agent plan) and the Pages build. Neither is measured. No briefing and no notebook: participants follow the page on their own laptops before Day 1, and an optional drop-in clinic on Day 1, 08:00–09:00, helps with installs. Nothing later depends on it.
- **Page:** `modules/00-coding-agents.qmd`.
- **What participants do:** install one coding agent (Claude Code, Codex or Gemini CLI); set up git and the GitHub CLI; in one language of their choice (Python or R), have the agent build (1) a protein structure explorer for ubiquitin (PDB 1UBQ) and (2) an RFM customer segmentation, each with a three.js page; check each app; publish both on GitHub Pages.
- **Reference solutions:** `agents-intro/`, with data files recorded as `datasets` entries in `_variables.yml`.
- **Stack:** a coding agent CLI, git, GitHub CLI, Python or R, three.js. npm package names and the versions checked on 2026-10-05 are in `_variables.yml` under `agents_intro`.
- **Instructor notes:** room setup, install failures per OS and the no-subscription fallback are in `facilitator-guide.md`; a provisional minute plan is in `instructor-pace.md`.

- **Objectives:** implement an accuracy reward and a proper-score reward, and explain from a toy model why only the second pays for honest probabilities; implement act, ask and escalate thresholds from stated costs, and choose them on development data; state what is and is not public about RLCD, and evaluate a decision model's answers by their probabilities, not their confidence field. (Verbs as in `_variables.yml`: implement, assemble, inspect, evaluate; revised 2026-10-06.)
- **Briefing:** RLHF versus RLCD: preference as the reward versus agreement with outcomes as the reward; what TypeSafe has stated publicly and what remains unpublished; System 1 (fast, typed decisions) versus System 2 (generative reasoning); Jev's interface: state plus typed questions in, typed answers (choice, score, yes/no) with confidence out; where a decision model fits in an LLM system: routing, guarding, verifying; turning confidence into policy: act, ask, escalate.
- **Lab `12-rlcd-jev.ipynb`:**
  1. Toy calibration-reward training: fine-tune a small decision model with a proper-scoring-rule reward and compare against an accuracy-only reward. **Labelled in the notebook as our illustration of the idea, not TypeSafe's method.**
  2. Call Jev on the Lab 11 decision set with typed questions.
  3. Plot Jev's reliability diagram beside the LLM's from Lab 11.
  4. Choose act / ask / escalate thresholds from a stated cost of error.
- **Stretch:** compare cost and latency of Jev against an LLM on the same decisions.
- **Stack:** PyTorch, `typesafe-sdk` (fallback: the toy model from step 1).
- **Readings:** TypeSafe's public RLCD and Jev announcement and API documentation; Kahneman on System 1 and System 2 for the framing.

#### Module 13 · Retrieval-augmented generation

- **Objectives:** assemble a RAG pipeline in LlamaIndex and LangChain; implement recall@k and MRR, and choose chunk size and top-k from a measured sweep; evaluate retrieval and answer quality separately. (Verbs as in `_variables.yml`: implement, assemble, inspect, evaluate; revised 2026-10-06.)
- **Briefing:** why retrieval (freshness, grounding, cost); the pipeline: load, chunk, embed, index, retrieve, rerank, generate; dense, sparse (BM25, linking back to Module 1) and hybrid retrieval; rerankers; evaluation: recall@k, MRR, faithfulness, answer relevance; common failures; LlamaIndex and LangChain: what each abstracts and where they overlap.
- **Lab `13-rag.ipynb`:** index a small document set (Workshop Lectures v1: a frozen snapshot of our own briefings, `data/workshop_lectures_v1.jsonl.gz`) with LlamaIndex; query it; vary chunk size and top-k and measure recall@k on a hand-labelled question set (`data/rag_questions_v1.jsonl`, 80 questions written and checked by people, spec in `briefs/13-rag.md`); build the same retriever as a LangChain runnable; add a reranking step (a Jev reranker written in the notebook on `typesafe-sdk`, since no official LlamaIndex integration exists; a cross-encoder is the fallback and the CI path); score faithfulness.
- **Stretch:** hybrid retrieval with BM25.
- **Stack:** LlamaIndex, LangChain, Jev, OpenAI/Claude (fallback: local embedding model and small local LLM).
- **Readings:** Lewis et al. 2020 (RAG); LlamaIndex and LangChain documentation.

### Day 5 — Agents and the capstone

#### Module 14 · Agents

- **Objectives:** assemble a tool-using agent as an explicit graph by writing its routing edges; drive human-in-the-loop interrupts, and replay and fork a checkpointed run; use a calibrated decision model for routing and tool-call approval, with thresholds from costs. (Verbs as in `_variables.yml`: implement, assemble, inspect, evaluate; revised 2026-10-06.)
- **Briefing:** from the hand-written tool loop of Module 8 to agents; the agent harness (agent = model + harness; not to be confused with an evaluation or test harness), with ARC-AGI's same-model, different-harness results as a worked example; ReAct; LangChain tools and runnables; tool design (descriptions, few tools, short results, actionable errors); LangGraph: nodes, edges, state, conditional routing, checkpoints, interrupts, resume or start fresh; where agents fail (loops, wrong tool, unsafe action, prompt injection), stopping on a final answer, and enforcement in code; using a System 1 model in the control loop: route, guard, verify, with thresholds from Module 12, plus escalation triggers and hand-offs; designing the harness: workflow patterns (Anthropic) and agentic design patterns (Ng), coordinators and subagents, context as a budget.
- **Lab `14-agents.ipynb`:** define tools (calculator, the Module 13 retriever, a mock "send email" action); build a ReAct-style LangGraph agent; add a Jev router node (`langchain-typesafe`) that picks the next step with a probability; gate the risky tool with an act / ask / escalate guard from Module 12's thresholds (a simulated human answers interrupts in unattended runs); replay from a checkpoint; test against a prompt-injection document.
- **Stretch (one section, four parts; pick one):** (A) a verification node that checks the final answer against the retrieved sources; (B) a research subagent with its own context, failures returned as results, and a coverage check at the coordinator; (C) compaction that keeps the facts word for word; (D) a hand-off record that stands alone.
- **Stack:** LangChain, LangGraph, Jev, OpenAI/Claude (fallback: local model and the Module 12 toy decision model).
- **Readings:** Yao et al. 2023 (ReAct); LangGraph documentation; Schluntz and Zhang 2024 (Building effective agents); Greshake et al. 2023; Beurer-Kellner et al. 2025.

#### Module 15 · Capstone (double slot)

- **Objectives:** combine retrieval, an agent graph and calibrated control into one system; evaluate it; explain the design choices to others.
- **Brief (10 min, 11:30–11:40):** the task, the starter system, the evaluation set and the scoring.
- **Build (110 min, 11:40–12:25 and 13:25–14:30, across lunch) `15-capstone.ipynb`:** a research-assistant agent over the workshop's own reading list. The starter provides LlamaIndex retrieval, a LangGraph plan–retrieve–answer–verify loop, Claude or OpenAI for generation, and Jev for routing and for a final "is this answer supported by the sources?" check with a confidence threshold. Participants work in pairs, run the fixed evaluation set for a baseline, then improve one component of their choice (retrieval, prompts, routing, thresholds, a new tool).
- **Evaluate and share (105 min, 14:45–16:30):** re-run the evaluation; report accuracy, abstention rate and cost against the baseline; each pair gives a two-minute account of what they changed and what happened.
- **Wrap-up (30 min, 16:30–17:00, ending in the closing slot):** the five days as one line of ideas; an evaluation checklist for agentic systems; open problems; further study.
- **Stack:** everything from Modules 8 to 14.

---

## 5. Lab standards

Every notebook must meet all of these.

- **Runs cold on free Colab.** A fresh T4 (or CPU where stated) runtime, Run all, no manual steps other than adding optional API keys. Target: under 10 minutes of compute per lab.
- **A core path that fits 50 minutes.** On Days 2–5 the lab slot is 55 minutes: the same 50-minute core path plus 5 minutes of slack for setup and downloads, then a 10-minute debrief. From-scratch labs ask participants to write the core function (the loss, the attention step, the update rule), not the whole model; scaffolding, data loading and training loops are provided.
- **One optional stretch section.** Clearly marked, placed last, never required by a later lab. It gives fast participants more to do and a slow group something to skip.
- **Generated header and footer.** Cell 0 (title, Colab badge, duration, objectives) and the final cell are written by `scripts/gen_notebooks.py`. Do not edit them by hand.
- **Setup cell.** Quiet, pinned `%pip install -q package==x.y.z` for anything Colab does not preinstall. Seeds are set here.
- **Exercises and solutions in one notebook.** Each exercise is a `# TODO N` stub, followed by a folded solution cell (`#@title Solution`, form view, source hidden) and a short "why this works" note. The solution is marked `@workshop.solution(N)` and never replaces the participant's code: the generated harness cell binds it only in worked mode (`WORKED_EXAMPLE`, or `NLP_LLMS_WORKED=1` in CI), and `workshop.use_reference(N)` lets a stuck participant go on (CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Checkpoints.** Each exercise ends with an assertion or a printed metric that tells the participant whether they got it right. A checkpoint cell starts with `workshop.checkpoint(N)` and reports whether it checked the participant's code or the reference; `scripts/test_notebooks.py --verify-checkpoints` proves each exercise's first checkpoint fails on the unfinished stub.
- **API keys.** Read from Colab Secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and the TypeSafe key name given in its documentation). Keys are never written into a cell.
- **Open-model fallback.** A single `PROVIDER` switch at the top of each API lab. With no keys set, the lab runs on a small Hugging Face model (and, for Jev, the toy decision model from Lab 12). The fallback path is the one CI executes.
- **Cost note.** Each API lab states its approximate cost per full run.
- **No outputs committed.** The generator strips outputs and execution counts.
- **Datasets.** Small, permissively licensed, fetched by URL with a fallback copy under `data/`.

## 6. Risks and open items

| Item | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| RLCD's method is unpublished | TypeSafe names RLCD and states its aim (docs.typesafe.ai, read 2026-10-06), but publishes no paper, reward function, algorithm or reliability data; teaching a guess at the method as fact would be speculation | Module 11 teaches calibration theory on its own footing; Module 12 states what is public and labels the toy lab as our own illustration |
| Jev package names and API surface | Checked 2026-10-05 against the published packages and TypeSafe's and LangChain's GitHub repositories (details and sources in `briefs/jev-verification.md`). `docs.typesafe.ai` was blocked from the build container; it was read from the build Mac on 2026-10-06 (`briefs/jev-verification.md`, section 12: it publishes the confidence formulas, the rate limits and Jev's price). **SDK:** PyPI `typesafe-sdk` 0.7.2 (MIT, by TypeSafe AI), import `typesafe_sdk`; `typesafe-sdk-python` is only the repository name and is not on PyPI. `TypeSafeClient` / `AsyncTypeSafeClient`, key from `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; `system_one(state, questions)` sends `POST /v1/systemone` with `Noul` / `Choice` / `Score` questions. `Choice` and `Score` answers carry `probabilities` and `confidence`; `Noul` carries only a probability, with no confidence field. There is no batch endpoint. **LangChain:** `langchain-typesafe` 0.0.1a3 (alpha; the class is `@beta`), `TypeSafeClassifier` confirmed; it does not depend on `typesafe-sdk`. **LlamaIndex:** there is no official integration: `llama-index-jev` does not exist, and `llama_index` main has no TypeSafe code | Use `typesafe-sdk==0.7.2` and `langchain-typesafe==0.0.1a3`. Write the Module 13 reranker in the notebook on the SDK, with a cross-encoder fallback. With no key, a local backend returns the same `SystemOneResponse` type. Re-read `docs.typesafe.ai` before each delivery: the confidence formulas, rate limits and prices can change. Section 4 now names only `typesafe-sdk` and says there is no LlamaIndex integration (corrected 2026-10-05) |
| Lookalike Jev packages on PyPI | Unaffiliated packages sit on names participants may guess: `typesafe-ai` (a shim by a private individual), `jev` (no author), `typesafe-client` (a placeholder), `typesafe` (unrelated, 2010) and `llama-index-postprocessor-jev` (an individual's reranker). The names `typesafe-sdk-python` and `llama-index-jev` are unregistered and could be taken by anyone | Print only `typesafe-sdk` and `langchain-typesafe`, with exact pins; warn participants in `setup.qmd`; add a test that fails if a notebook or page installs any other TypeSafe-like name |
| Jev confidence semantics | `confidence` measures how concentrated the distribution is, not the probability of the chosen label. TypeSafe publishes the formulas (docs, read 2026-10-06): for a choice it is the emulator's rescaled top probability, a score uses a distance-weighted measure, and a yes/no answer has none. A recorded live response had probabilities rounded to 0.01 | Lab 12 draws reliability diagrams from `noul` and `probabilities[choice]`, never from `confidence`, and says why. Thresholds are explicit numbers derived from a stated cost of error |
| Jev experimental LangChain middleware | `AutoModeMiddleware` blocks risky tool calls at a hard-coded p ≥ 0.5 and never asks a human. It works only with `create_agent`, and omitting `criteria` silently drops its default criteria | Lab 14 writes its own act / ask / escalate guard node with `interrupt()` and explicit thresholds, and quotes the middleware's instructions only as an example |
| RLCD primary sources | Until 2026-10-05 the TypeSafe material read (SDK, `skills`, `system-one-adapter`, `WorkflowEvals`) never named RLCD. TypeSafe's documentation, read 2026-10-06, does: Jev "is trained with RLCD to return calibrated decisions". The announcement blog post is still unread | Module 12 quotes the documentation with links and dates and keeps the method's details, which are unpublished, apart from our illustration. The quotations await Romeo's sign-off (the `typesafe-unverified` notice). Labs 13–15 and briefs 12–15 still say the rate limits are unpublished: correct them when those notebooks are next edited (Phase 2) |
| Jev access | Participants may not have keys | Fallback path; ask TypeSafe about workshop credits |
| Model IDs change | Hard-coded IDs go stale | IDs live only in `_variables.yml`; pinned during the build |
| Colab dependency drift | Preinstalled versions change and break labs | Pinned installs; scheduled `health.yml` run |
| Five consecutive days | Fatigue by Day 5; harder for working practitioners to attend | Day 5 is mostly hands-on pair work; Days 1–2 and Days 3–5 can be offered as separate units (FAQ) |
| Build size | 15 briefings and 16 notebooks | Two-week build with parallel agent workstreams (see AGENTS.md), then continued review |
| LangChain / LangGraph / LlamaIndex API churn | Tutorials age quickly | Pin versions; use only core, stable interfaces |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 retirement | Anthropic lists its retirement as "not sooner than 2026-10-15" (checked 2026-10-05); Lab 8 and Module 8 pin it | Re-check before each delivery; change `models.anthropic` and the three dated sentences in Module 8 |
| Capstone questions need human authors | The capstone evaluation set is Lab 13's 80 questions plus 45 new human-written ones (about 30% unanswerable, including memory-bait items) | Romeo and one instructor write and blind-check them after Lab 13's set (about 3 and 2 hours) |
| Corpus snapshot ordering | `data/workshop_lectures_v1.jsonl.gz` freezes the briefings and `references.qmd`; questions quote it verbatim | Finish `references.qmd` (Modules 1–12) and rebuild the snapshot before anyone writes questions |
| RAG questions need human authors | Model-written questions copy passage wording (inflating BM25) and model relevance labels are circular with the judge Lab 13 teaches people to check | Romeo and one instructor write and blind-check 80 questions (about 4 and 3 hours); a first batch of 40 unblocks the notebook |
| Lab 11 depends on the Lab 6 logits | Resolved 2026-10-06: `lab06_logits.npz` is committed, from Lab 6's GPU settings on the build Mac's GPU (MPS), not a T4 (test accuracy 0.8975). A T4 run may give slightly different logits | Lab 11 still falls back to the Lab 1 classifier if the file cannot be loaded; replace the file after a T4 run if its numbers differ materially |
| Decision set labels need two human annotators | An agent can build the generator but cannot provide independent human labels or write the hand items (the spec forbids model-written items) | Romeo and one instructor write and label 80 hand items and audit 60 template items (estimated 2–3 hours each) |
| Labs 9 and 10 depend on GPT-2 | They need the Hub (and Lab 10 a GPU); the build container has neither | Lab 9's data files and reward model were built on the build Mac and committed (2026-10-06); Lab 10's seed protocol still needs a Colab T4 |
| Module 0 tools change fast | The agent CLIs release several times a week, and their install methods and plan terms change (Claude Code's docs now recommend its native installer over npm). Only Gemini CLI states a free tier (personal Google account); Claude Code needs a paid plan or Console account; OpenAI's Codex plan pages could not be read from the build container | Versions and the check date live in `_variables.yml` `assistants` and `agents_intro`; re-check installs and plan terms before each delivery; participants without a subscription pair up or use Gemini CLI |
| Build container network | The cloud build environment blocks huggingface.co, so Labs 6–8's model paths and the Lab 6/7 data files cannot be produced there | Allow huggingface.co in the environment's network settings, or run those steps on Colab |

## 7. Development task list

Ten working days to a first complete version, then continued review. Briefings and labs for the same module are built in parallel by different agents, then reviewed together.

### Day 1 — Repository setup

- [x] `git init`, default branch `main`, create the GitHub repository
- [x] Add `LICENSE` (CC BY 4.0 for content, MIT for code) and `CITATION.cff`
- [x] Add `.gitignore` (`docs/`, `.venv/`, `uv.lock`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`)
- [x] Write `pyproject.toml` with uv dependency groups: `notebooks`, `site`, `test`, `lint`, `execute`

- [x] Choose and record the datasets for the running thread (classification set, LM corpus, date transduction, instruction set, preference set, decision set, RAG documents). Decisions and licenses are in `data/README.md`: arXiv Topics v1 replaces AG News (license), Tiny Shakespeare, Dolly 15k. The repo-hosted fallback URLs work only once the repository is public and `data/` is on `main`

### Day 2 — Quarto initialisation

- [x] Write `_quarto.yml`: website project, `output-dir: docs`, explicit `render:` list, notebooks as `resources:`, navbar
- [x] Write `custom.scss` (cosmo override) and vendor the fonts
- [x] Create `index.qmd`, `setup.qmd`, `schedule.qmd`, `day-1.qmd` to `day-4.qmd`, `notebooks.qmd`, `references.qmd`, `faq.qmd`, `teach.qmd`
- [x] Create a module page template and stub all 15 pages under `modules/`
- [x] Write `scripts/gen_tables.py` (schedule, notebook index, README regions)
- [x] Write `scripts/gen_notebooks.py` (header and footer cells, Colab badge, output stripping, idempotent)

- [x] Confirm `quarto render` is clean
- [x] Enable GitHub Pages (set Pages to deploy from GitHub Actions) and confirm the site deploys to <https://project-delphi.github.io/nlp-llms/>

### Day 3 — Modules 1–2

- [x] Draft briefing 1: Text as data
- [x] Draft briefing 2: Word vectors and neural networks
- [x] Code `01-text-as-data.ipynb`
- [x] Code `02-word-vectors.ipynb` (run on CPU, not Colab)
- [ ] Review: each equation maps to a lab line; both labs run cold in Colab within budget (equation-to-lab half done for Modules 1 and 2; Colab half open)

### Day 4 — Modules 3–4

- [x] Draft briefing 3: Sequence models
- [x] Draft briefing 4: Seq2seq and attention
- [x] Code `03-sequence-models.ipynb` (run on CPU, not Colab)
- [x] Code `04-seq2seq-attention.ipynb` (run on CPU, not Colab)
- [x] Produce the Day 1 figures (RNN unrolling, LSTM gates, attention alignment; the alignment map is now drawn from Lab 4's measured weights)
- [ ] Review: Day 1 reads as one thread; Lab 3 perplexity is compared with Lab 1 (the Lab 3 comparison is done; the cross-module read of Day 1 is open)

### Day 5 — Modules 5–6

- [x] Draft briefing 5: The transformer
- [x] Draft briefing 6: Pretraining and the Hugging Face stack
- [x] Code `05-transformer-from-scratch.ipynb` (run on CPU, not Colab)
- [ ] Code `06-pretraining-huggingface.ipynb` (written; offline parts run; pretrained path not run: Hub blocked)
- [ ] Review: Labs 3 → 5 and 1 → 2 → 6 comparisons report consistent metrics on the same data (3 → 5 and 1 → 2 done; 6 waits on its pretrained run)

### Day 6 — Modules 7–8

- [x] Draft briefing 7: Fine-tuning and LoRA
- [x] Draft briefing 8: LLMs through APIs
- [ ] Code `07-finetuning-lora.ipynb` (written; LoRA layer and offline parts run; SmolLM2 + Dolly path not run: Hub blocked)
- [ ] Code `08-llm-apis.ipynb` with the provider wrapper and the fallback path (written; runs end to end on an offline stub; OpenAI, Claude and Qwen paths not run)
- [x] Pin OpenAI and Claude model IDs in `_variables.yml`
- [ ] Add repository secrets and make CI skip keyed paths when they are absent (labs read keys from Colab Secrets or the environment and take their no-key path when absent; `health.yml`'s keyed leg uses the secrets; Romeo to add them)
- [ ] Review: Lab 8 completes with no keys set (holds on the stub only; the Qwen fallback has not run)

### Day 7 — Modules 9–10

- [x] Draft briefing 9: Reinforcement and preference learning
- [x] Draft briefing 10: RLHF
- [ ] Code `09-preference-learning.ipynb` (written; Part A run on CPU with seed-based thresholds; Part B run on the committed data on the build Mac's CPU, with Exercise 4's thresholds set from seeds 0 to 2 (2026-10-06); not yet run on Colab)
- [ ] Code `10-rlhf.ipynb`, including the pre-trained reward model checkpoint (written, with `scripts/lab10_seed_protocol.py`; the checkpoint `data/lab09_reward_model.pt` is committed; the real GPT-2 path ran on the build Mac's CPU in `FAST` mode only, where every unit checkpoint passes and the trained-policy checkpoints are skipped (2026-10-06); Checkpoint 1's tolerance was corrected to measured float32 noise; the T4 path has not run)
- [x] Build the Lab 9 data files (`data/build_lab09_preferences.py`) on a machine with Hub access and record their statistics (built 2026-10-06 on the build Mac's CPU after the frames were changed to pass the acceptance criteria; statistics in `data/README.md` and the brief's "As built" note; the three files added 5.99 MB, so the cap in `tests/test_data.py` is now 12 MB)
- [ ] Review: the reward-hacking demonstration is reliable across seeds (protocol in `briefs/10-rlhf.md`; needs a Colab T4). Not done. One exploratory full-settings run on Apple M1 Pro (MPS), seed 0, 2026-10-06, passed the provisional signature checks. Its gold gap was narrow (0.152 against 0.1), and the beta = 0 policy collapsed to "good as as as …" rather than stuffing list words. That is one seed, not the protocol. Module 10, Lab 10's Step 0 and Exercise 4 notes and knowledge check 10.4 now name the three ways the gold reward can fall and describe this run as exploratory (Academic Director, 2026-10-06)

### Day 8 — Modules 11–12

- [ ] Verify Jev SDK, LangChain and LlamaIndex integration names and signatures against `docs.typesafe.ai`; update section 6 of this file with what was found (verified against the published packages and the TypeSafe and LangChain repositories; `docs.typesafe.ai` was blocked and is still unread, see `briefs/jev-verification.md`; left unticked until the docs are read from a networked machine)
- [x] Draft briefing 11: Calibration
- [x] Draft briefing 12: RLCD and Jev (public facts and our illustration clearly separated; TypeSafe's own statements are a TODO for Romeo until docs.typesafe.ai is read)
- [ ] Code `11-calibration.ipynb` (written; classifier exercises run on the Lab 1 fallback; LLM part run on the labelled stub only; keyed, open-model and Lab 6 paths not run)
- [ ] Code `12-rlcd-jev.ipynb` (written; local toy-decider path run on the decision set and reviewed against Module 12; keyed Jev and the stretch not run)
- [ ] Build and label the shared decision set used by Labs 11, 12 and 14 (spec in `briefs/11-calibration.md`; template-only v1 built and committed, `data/decisions_v1.jsonl.gz`: `data/build_decisions.py` generates the template items; Romeo and one instructor write and label the 80 hand-written items and audit 60 template items)
- [ ] Review: the RLCD honesty rule (AGENTS.md) holds in both the briefing and the lab

### Day 9 — Modules 13–15

- [x] Draft briefing 13: Retrieval-augmented generation
- [x] Draft briefing 14: Agents
- [x] Draft the Module 15 capstone brief and wrap-up
- [ ] Code `13-rag.ipynb` (written; offline BM25 path run on plumbing probes; corpus snapshot v1 built, provisional until `references.qmd` is finished; neural, keyed and Jev paths not run; no retrieval numbers until the human questions exist)
- [ ] Code `14-agents.ipynb` (written; stub agent + toy router + stub guard path run, with Lab 13's BM25 retriever restated; keyed and Jev paths not run; the open path with Qwen ran end to end on an Apple laptop CPU in 263 s on 2026-10-06)
- [ ] Code `15-capstone.ipynb` with its starter system and fixed evaluation set (written; stub path run on plumbing probes, self-test 14/14; scoring script, collector and manifest builder tested; keyed, open and Jev paths not run; blocked on the 125 human questions and the frozen snapshot)
- [ ] Smoke-test every keyed path (OpenAI, Claude, Jev) and every fallback path

### Day 10 — Final review and release

- [ ] Run all 16 notebooks on a fresh free-tier Colab runtime; record run time and API cost per lab
- [ ] Timing dry-run of each module against its budget (45 briefing + 50 lab on Day 1; 55 + 55 + a 10-minute debrief on Days 2–5); move overflow into stretch sections
- [ ] Content review of all 15 briefings: objectives met, notation consistent, prerequisites honoured
- [x] Write `facilitator-guide.md`, `instructor-pace.md` and `knowledge-checks.md` (entry and knowledge checks)
- [ ] Complete `references.qmd` and check every citation (complete for all 15 modules, 135 entries; 45 checked against primary records, 85 against search summaries only because the proxy blocks arXiv, ACL Anthology and most publishers; recheck those from a networked machine)
- [ ] Link check, spelling pass, accessibility pass (alt text, heading order, contrast)
- [ ] Licence and attribution check for datasets, figures and borrowed code
- [ ] Add `health.yml` (scheduled notebook run) (written: weekly offline, Hub and manual keyed legs; validated with actionlint; not yet run on GitHub)
- [ ] Final `README.md` with badges and the generated module table
- [ ] Tag `v1.0.0`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, confirm the deployed site

### Module 0 — Coding agents in the terminal (added 2026-10-05)

- [x] Draft `modules/00-coding-agents.qmd` (install commands checked 2026-10-05 against each tool's docs, npm package or README; its two `awk` hand checks run against the reference outputs; not rendered, not tried in a real terminal)
- [x] Reference solutions under `agents-intro/` for both apps, in each language the page offers, with checks (Python and R both run; headless renders checked)
- [x] Data files for the two apps, with `datasets` entries in `_variables.yml` (`data/1ubq.pdb` from a pinned mirror, CC0 partly verified; `data/purchases_v1.csv.gz`, synthetic; UCI Online Retail II license unverified)
- [x] Wiring: `modules.m00` (`notebook: false`), the `self_serve` slot and `days.d1.self_serve`, `agents_intro` versions; generators, tests, navbar, day, schedule, setup, index and teach pages; facilitator guide and pace sheet sections; `agents-intro` in the ruff paths 
- [ ] Verify every install command (the three agents, git, `gh`) against each tool's current documentation, and refresh `agents_intro`, before each delivery
- [ ] Run Module 0 end to end on a fresh laptop per OS (macOS, Windows with WSL 2, Linux); record the times and replace the provisional rows in `instructor-pace.md`

### Module 14 — certification, harness and ARC-AGI pass (added 2026-10-06)

- [x] Briefing 14: the harness defined in section 1, with a terminology note and an ARC-AGI worked example; tool design in section 3; resume or start fresh in section 5; stopping and enforcement in section 6; escalation triggers and hand-offs in section 7; a new section 9 (patterns, subagents, context) with an optional Claude Agent SDK and MCP mapping. Sources: the *Claude Certified Architect – Foundations* exam guide v1.0, Anthropic's engineering posts, Ng's letters in *The Batch*, ARC Prize's reports and leaderboard, all opened 2026-10-06. Three optional callouts moved out of the 45 minutes to make room. Rendered clean with Quarto 1.6.40
- [x] `references.qmd` (Module 14 and library documentation), Module 0's harness sentence, Module 15's further study, brief 14's note for the Lab Engineer
- [x] Desk timing of the rebalanced Module 14 (2026-10-06). The measure is words of in-budget material (outside collapsed callouts, check-yourself questions and demos) per budgeted minute, the same count as for the 11 other briefings with a timing table. Per briefing, those run from 64 to 112 words a minute (median 98); per section, median 92 and 90th percentile 147. Module 14 carried 7,376 words, 164 a minute, about 75 minutes at the median briefing's density; its section 1 ran at 251 and section 9 at 337. Before the harness pass it carried 4,395 words, 98 a minute. The ARC-AGI worked example, tool-design habits, resume or start fresh, the stopping rule, escalation triggers and the hand-off, and the detail on subagents and context moved into collapsed optional callouts, with a short in-budget summary where a point is needed; nothing was deleted. Sections 5 and 9 are now 5 minutes each. Result, in the same units: 5,259 words, 117 a minute per briefing (about 5% above the densest other briefing), sections from 90 to 134 a minute (below the 90th percentile). The pace sheet has the new rows and a "briefing behind" rule: give section 9 as reading, stated once, in the briefing's timing note. Rendered clean
- [ ] Spoken dry-run of Module 14 against the 45 minutes: the desk timing is a proxy that cannot tell a table row from a sentence
- [x] Lab 14 stretch exercises for the new material: parts B (research subagent, `run_subagent` and `coverage_gaps`), C (`compact`) and D (`handoff`) beside part A (the verify node), each with a folded solution and a scripted checkpoint; spec in brief 14. The core path is unchanged
- [x] Decide whether `m14` objectives gain a fourth (designing the harness): **no** (decided 2026-10-06). The lab standards require the core path to exercise every module objective, and only the optional stretch exercises harness design; after the desk timing, most of section 9's detail is optional too. Sections 1 and 9 keep their own section objectives. Revisit if a core exercise on harness design is added, or after the pilot
- [x] Lab 14 stretch, part A: a run with no retrieved passages is delivered as `no-sources`, with no verifier call, instead of a verdict against nothing (the question left open by the review of PR #8; decided and built 2026-10-06; spec in brief 14). The checkpoint adds a calculator-only run, a search with a missing argument, a search that times out and a search with no hits. A run that searched and then only calculated or confirmed is still judged against its passages (recorded in brief 14 as open). Run with the solutions on the stub path (passes, 16.5 s) and on the open-model path with no keys (passes, 260 s on an Apple laptop CPU; the Qwen verifier scored 6 of 12 on the pairs, chance level, printed and not asserted); keyed paths not run
- [ ] Re-read the ARC-AGI figures and Anthropic's posts before each delivery: the leaderboard reprices runs, and "Building effective agents" has already been edited once since 2024

### Ongoing review (after v1.0)

- [ ] Pilot one day with a small group; record where the clock slipped and which checkpoints confused people
- [ ] Revise module objectives and stretch sections from pilot feedback
- [ ] Re-verify Jev, LangChain, LangGraph and LlamaIndex APIs and pins monthly
- [ ] Revisit Module 12 whenever TypeSafe publishes more about RLCD
- [ ] Decide on the v1 exclusions: briefing slide decks, quizzes, Spanish translation

## 8. Five-day revision (approved 2026-10-06)

Romeo approved a revision from four to five days after a review brief and a critique of it. This section tracks the work.

**Decisions:**

- **The days.** Day 1 keeps four 95-minute modules (M1–M4). Days 2–5 run three 120-minute modules each: 55 minutes of briefing with the activities inside, a 55-minute lab and a 10-minute debrief, with 15 minutes of warm-up each morning and 15 of wrap-up at the end of the day. Day 2 is M5–M7, Day 3 M8–M10, Day 4 M11–M13, and Day 5 M14 and the capstone.
- **Notebooks.** One notebook per lab, with an explicit worked-example switch.
- **Measurement.** On the build Mac only for now. Colab and T4 stay "not verified" and block the release check.
- **Delivery.** One pull request per phase.

### Phase 1 — Truth and readiness metadata

- [x] `_variables.yml`: a `readiness` block and per-module `readiness` fields, covering content state, runtime, planning estimate, accounts, cost, what the no-key fallback means, known gaps, and blocking work with mechanical checks
- [x] `runs/` run records with a schema (`runs/README.md`, `scripts/run_records.py`), backfilled from CI run 37463984863, `data/baselines.json` and the briefs. Backfilled records never count as teaching evidence
- [x] `scripts/readiness.py`. `scripts/gen_tables.py` writes `_includes/readiness.md`, `_includes/readiness-summary.md` and the README status region. New page `readiness.qmd`; new `tests/test_runs.py`
- [x] Stale and contradictory readiness claims on the landing page, FAQ, setup, teach and notebooks pages, the facilitator guide and the pace sheet are replaced by the generated summary or corrected:
  - the capstone notebook and the collector exist;
  - the repository is public;
  - the Lab 2 and Lab 14 measurements are corrected;
  - the setup page links straight to the setup notebook in Colab.
- [x] Entry-check threshold made consistent: two or more of the three questions in an area missed
- [x] Dated status notes on briefs 09, 10, 11 and 15
- [ ] TypeSafe's documentation read on 2026-10-06, and Module 12, references, knowledge checks and Lab 12 corrected: TypeSafe now names RLCD and publishes its confidence formulas. The quotations await Romeo's sign-off (the `typesafe-unverified` notice)

### Phase 2 — Exercise harness and run records

- [x] `scripts/harness.py`. `scripts/gen_notebooks.py` writes a harness cell after each notebook's header and a summary cell before its footer:
  - the `WORKED_EXAMPLE` switch (`NLP_LLMS_WORKED=1` in CI);
  - `@workshop.solution(N)` and `workshop.solution_value(...)`;
  - `workshop.use_reference(N)`;
  - `workshop.checkpoint(N | label=)`, which reports whose code it checked;
  - `workshop.summary()` and `workshop.run_record()`.
- [x] `scripts/migrate_exercises.py` applied to every lab: 80 solution cells marked, pure stubs raise `NotImplementedError("TODO N")`, every checkpoint cell names what it checks (reviewed override table), and the introductions rewritten. Special cases: Lab 7's `merged_weight` attachment moved into Checkpoint 2; Lab 15's exercise and self-test tagged.
- [x] `scripts/test_notebooks.py`:
  - worked mode by default;
  - `--learner`: each lab must stop at a checkpoint with the harness's message;
  - `--verify-checkpoints`: each exercise's first checkpoint must fail on its stub;
  - `--record --env`: writes a run-record batch;
  - data is read from a temporary copy, so runs never add files to `data/`.
- [x] `scripts/add_run_record.py` turns a notebook's printed run record into a `runs/` file.
- [x] New `tests/test_exercises.py`. `tests/test_lab14.py` and `tests/test_lab15.py` skip the harness marker in restated definitions.
- [x] CI: `publish.yml` runs every notebook with `--verify-checkpoints` and then a learner smoke test; the blocking offline leg of `health.yml` runs `--verify-checkpoints` weekly.
- [x] Docs: CONTRIBUTING, PLAN §5, the AGENTS.md definition of done, the facilitator guide and the notebooks page.
- [x] Review round 5 of PR #10 fixed in the readiness code:
  - a stale record never outranks a current one;
  - the CI sentence applies staleness;
  - a newer partial pass no longer hides a full one;
  - the item checks never crash;
  - dates are real and not in the future.
- [x] The CI backfill record's setting names corrected. They are `NLP_LLMS_LAB07_OFFLINE` and so on, not `LAB07_OFFLINE`.
- [x] Labs 13–15 and the facilitator guide now cite TypeSafe's published price and rate limits (Models page, read 2026-10-06).

### Phase 3 — Five-day restructure

- [x] Clock profiles (`schedule.clocks.standard` and `.long`, each with a briefing/lab/debrief `shape`; `part: briefing`/`part: lab` slots let module B span lunch), `days.dN.clock`, `days.d5`, new day titles and questions, Module 8 moved to Day 3, Module 0 as pre-work (`day: 0`) with `days.d1.clinic`, `m15.minutes: 240`; `workshop.lecture_minutes`/`lab_minutes` dropped
- [x] Generators: `units()`, `placements()`, `minutes_of()`, `shape()`, split `module_clock()`, `timing()`; one timetable per clock with inline `flex-grow` bars; `_includes/module-shape.md`; a pre-work sidebar section; a generated README day table; notebook headers with the split (`gen_notebooks.py` imports `timing`)
- [x] Tests: per-clock slot arithmetic and back-to-back slots, units against day slots, every module placed once or pre-work, the clinic module is pre-work, `minutes == minutes_of()`, `day-5.qmd`, the `_quarto.yml` render list and Days menu
- [x] Pages: `day-5.qmd`; day 2–4 intros; `_quarto.yml`; `custom.scss` (five-column day grid, per-clock timetables, debrief, closing and clinic styles); schedule, landing, setup, teach, FAQ, references, README, `pyproject.toml`; Modules 0, 1, 8, 10, 12 and 15 (the capstone retimed to Day 5: brief 10, build 110 across lunch, evaluate and share 105, wrap-up 30 into the closing slot; awaiting the Academic Director's review); knowledge checks; this file's sections 1–6
- [x] Restructure the day-by-day sections of `instructor-pace.md` and `facilitator-guide.md` for 55/55/10 and Day 5 (done in Phase 4, on the live plans). Pace sheet: Days 1–5 in order; each module's briefing rows are the generated `_includes/pace-NN.md`, followed by its lab rows counted from the start of the lab (on Days 2–5 the 5 minutes of slack sit in the first row and a debrief row closes the table); module B split across lunch; warm-up and wrap-up rows pointing to the day pages; Day 5 is Module 14 then Module 15's retimed capstone plan. Every "behind" rule kept, restated in lab minutes (Module 14's briefing rule now at briefing minute 38). Facilitator guide: "The shape of each day" (warm-up, live briefing, lab, debrief, lunch split, wrap-up) and ordered "When the clock slips" rules for 55/55/10; per-day opening lines (Days 2–5 at the end of warm-up; the honesty rule moved to the Day 4 opening); a debrief per module of Days 2–5 (numbers, one misconception, the bridge); per-day wrap-up notes; the capstone at 10 + 110 + 105 + 30; stale items fixed (the Day 3 opening, the TODO box, now the `typesafe-unverified` sign-off, an obsolete Lab 3 checkpoint note, Jev's rate limits). The four-day notices are removed from both pages and from `teach.qmd`. Minutes remain planning estimates
- [x] The Academic Director prompt in `AGENTS.md` now targets the module's briefing minutes (45 on Day 1, 55 on Days 2–5), activities included, from the live plan (`scripts/live_plan.py`). `.claude/agents/academic-director.md` has no activation prompt (it defers to `AGENTS.md`), so it needed no change
- [x] Notebook 08's closing markdown names Modules 9 and 10, later on Day 3, and Module 11 on Day 4. Both the Phase 3 and Phase 4 branches edited it; the merge keeps the Phase 3 sentence

### Phase 4 — Live teaching sequence, objectives and knowledge check

- [ ] Live plans, objective verbs, Module 12 as calibrated decisions, `prepare.qmd`, warm-up and wrap-up, Module 0 as pre-work
  - [x] `prepare.qmd` (Before Day 1): the entry check, the two-or-more rule with named sections of free resources per area (links checked with curl on 2026-10-06), the setup notebook and what its output looks like, Module 0 as optional pre-work, then Module 1. The entry check moved to `prepare/entry-check.md` (hand-written, outside the generated `_includes/`), included by `prepare.qmd` and `knowledge-checks.md`. Linked from the landing hero ("Start here"), setup and teach
  - [x] Warm-up (five knowledge check questions, about three from the previous day and two from earlier days, linked by id) and day wrap-up (fixed and left open, the running table of the day's labs) on `day-2.qmd` to `day-5.qmd`; a pointer in `teach.qmd`; `knowledge-checks.md` "How to use them" matches
  - [x] Leftovers of the live plans: Module 3's equation-to-lab map no longer gives away Lab 3's answers (Exercise 3A's decay and `spectral_W`, the LSTM/RNN comparison); Lab 12's restated-cell comment points to Module 12, section 8 (was 6, before the reorder); `gen_notebooks.py` rerun, which also refreshed the generated cells left stale by the reworded objectives and titles: the headers of Labs 2–6, 8, 13 and 14 and Lab 11's footer
  - [x] Leftovers fixed at the merge with Phase 3: the facts strip names the 10-minute lab debriefs; Lab 15 and Module 15 say "capstone" where they said "afternoon", and brief 15 says it was written for the four-day plan; the facilitator guide gives Jev's price from TypeSafe's Models page (the documentation has no pricing page); Module 0 gives an honest estimate (about 90 minutes with one-time setup; App 2 is the part to postpone), and `m00.readiness.estimate_minutes` is 90; section 7's timing dry-run names both budgets; the CHANGELOG gains a Phase 4 entry
  - [x] Knowledge checks of Modules 5, 12 and 13 renumbered to the reworded objectives (5.1a→5.1, 5.1b→5.2a, 5.2→5.2b; 12.1b→12.1, 12.3→12.2, 12.1a→12.3a, 12.2→12.3b; 13.1→13.1a, 13.2b→13.1b, 13.3a→13.2b, 13.3b→13.3); every knowledge check has an anchor, `#q<module>-<objective>`

- [ ] Watch in the pilot: Module 1, section 6 (precision, recall and F1) and Module 3, section 7 (sampling) are marked Reference, but Lab 1 and Lab 3 use them in core exercises. Neither section is in its live plan, so participants meet them in the lab with the page open. If they stall on those exercises, move the section back into the live plan
- [ ] Follow-ups from the Phase 3 review (latent; none affects the current five-day schedule): `days_label` assumes consecutive days; some prose times are typed rather than generated (the warm-up and wrap-up headings of `day-2.qmd` to `day-5.qmd`, and `teach.qmd`), so a change to `schedule.clocks.long` must be copied to them by hand; `module_clock` does not name the days when a module spans more than one; `clinic_of` raises a bare `StopIteration` when no day has a clinic; one `units()` error message names the wrong cause; `ORDINALS` stops at six; `module_placements` is recomputed per call; module `minutes` are stored by hand beside `minutes_of()` (a test keeps them equal)

### Phase 5 — Desktop UX and accessibility

- [x] Native disclosure: `filters/disclosure.lua` (pre-ast, after `pedagogy.lua` and `live.lua`) writes every collapsed callout (293 on the site) as `<details>`/`<summary>` inside Quarto's callout frame; `custom.scss` restores the header colors per type in both themes. A link into a closed callout, or to the callout's own id, opens it and lands below the navbar (`scroll-margin-top`); printing opens them all. The filter follows the document's `callout-appearance` and `callout-icon`, and keeps a title that markdown would read as a list ("1. Why softmax?") as literal text. `check_links.py` fails if a Bootstrap collapse toggle is left in a callout (checked against the Phase 4 render: 18 pages flagged)
- [x] Demo theming: the 52 hex colors (and one `white`) in the briefings' Observable JS are `var(--demo-*)` custom properties, defined on `:root` in `custom.scss` with dark values in `custom-dark.scss`; Observable Plot accepts them as constant colors and in scale ranges, so the plots follow the theme toggle without re-rendering, and the dark theme's light "paper" demo panel is gone. Module 6's token chips keep one palette with their own ink in both themes. `tests/test_demo_colors.py` keeps hex values out of demo code (it fails 14 briefings on the old code)
- [x] Journeys: the navbar is Home, Start here (`prepare.qmd`), Schedule, Days, Notebooks, References, Teach; Setup, FAQ and Readiness moved to the footer (`tests/test_variables.py` checks both). Each day page has a generated run sheet (`_includes/run-N.md`): per module its times, the live plan's minutes, the lab, and what to do when something goes wrong (run the exercise's folded Solution cell, then `workshop.use_reference(N)`; and the fallback without keys). Briefing headers show when each part runs ("11:30 briefing · 13:25 lab · 14:20 debrief"); a "next activity" line was not added, since the part times give it
- [x] Browser checks: `scripts/check_browser.py` (Playwright, Chromium) serves `docs/` and checks every page at 1280 x 800 and a representative set at 1440 x 900, 1920 x 1080 and 1366 x 768 at 150% zoom, each in both themes: the theme applied, no sideways scroll, the navbar, no script errors or failed requests, KaTeX typeset, every demo drawn without an Observable error, and the keyboard path through an answer (Tab, focus ring, Enter, Space). 122 checks (114 page loads and 8 keyboard runs), 0 problems on this Mac and on the CI runner; against the Phase 4 render it flags the old navbar and the missing `<details>`. A check that throws is reported as a finding and the run goes on. Runs in its own `browser` job of `publish.yml` on the site the render job built, so a CDN hiccup cannot hold up the deploy; `browser` dependency group

- [ ] Follow-ups: vendor Observable Plot and KaTeX into the site, so the `browser` job no longer depends on jsDelivr and can then gate the deploy (`deploy.needs`); share one callout-title helper between `filters/pedagogy.lua` and `filters/disclosure.lua`; teach `scripts/test_notebooks.py --record` to mark a lab's smaller CPU path (Lab 5's default QUICK, Lab 6's BERT-mini, Lab 7's and Lab 10's FAST) as a partial run instead of relying on a hand edit (`runs/` records of 2026-10-06 were marked by hand); Lab 6's checkpoint 5c has no accuracy floor for any device but `cuda` and `cpu`

### Phase 6 — Real-path runs, environment and release check

- [x] Committed lockfile: `uv.lock` (206 packages) is tracked; CI's notebook runs and every `health.yml` leg use `uv run --locked`, and `--locked` fails the notebooks job if the lock no longer matches `pyproject.toml` (the render job stays outside the project, so a docs-only change never waits on a package index). Colab does not read it: notebooks keep their own pins, and a delivery picks a dated Colab runtime
- [x] Drift leg: `health.yml` leg `drift` runs the offline leg after `uv lock --upgrade` and lists what moved in the job summary; non-blocking
- [x] Release check: `scripts/release_check.py [--as-of DATE]` lists every blocker (no passing teaching run of the current code on its own runtime, dated no later than the release date and within `max_run_age_days`, for the setup notebook or any lab; or an open readiness item) and exits 1 if any; `tests/test_release_check.py`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs it on a `v*` tag and creates the GitHub Release only if it passes; a manual run is a dry run by default. As of 2026-10-06 it lists 27 blockers: neither the setup notebook nor any lab has a teaching run on its Colab runtime (16), and 11 items are open
- [x] Lab 9 data and Lab 10 reward model, built on real GPT-2 samples on the build Mac (tie share 0.50, Acc* 0.70 at the chosen threshold; files pinned by hash in both labs); Modules 9 and 10, Lab 10 and knowledge check 10.4 corrected after an exploratory MPS run (backfill record)
- [x] Lab 6 logits for Lab 11: Lab 6's GPU settings run on the build Mac's GPU (MPS) from a copy changed only to use it; DistilBERT, test accuracy 0.8975; registered as `datasets.lab06_logits`. Lab 11 now analyzes the encoder (ECE 0.039 before temperature scaling, 0.036 after, tau* 1.097). Not a T4 run
- [x] Real-path runs on the build Mac with `--record --env mac-m1pro`, no API keys, `--expect-hub`: every lab passed (`runs/`). Labs 1–5, 8, 9 and 11–15 ran end to end (Lab 5 also with QUICK forced off: 770 s); Labs 6, 7 and 10 took their smaller CPU paths and are recorded as partial; Labs 13 and 15 scored plumbing probes until the question sets exist. Other jobs (tests, renders, reviews) shared the machine during some runs, so times are upper estimates; one Lab 15 run spanned an idle sleep and was discarded and rerun under `caffeinate` (776 s), and every kept record's total agrees with its cell times. Never labeled T4
- [x] Lab 9 runs on its committed data in the blocking CI job and the offline and drift legs (checked hermetically: empty Hub cache, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, worked, `--verify-checkpoints` and `--learner`); Lab 10 keeps its stand-in there because it needs GPT-2 from the Hub. Labs 9, 10 and 15 join the Hub leg of `health.yml`, whose limits rise to 360 minutes and 3,600 s per cell
- [x] Capstone infrastructure that needs no people: `data/capstone_questions_TEMPLATE.md` (schema, memory bait, the blind-check protocol, validate, manifest, then the recorded baselines); a `data/README.md` section and catalog row; `rag_questions_tools.py agreement` now also reports how many unanswerable items the checker also found nothing for (tested). The readiness item `capstone-questions` and the release check list the set until it exists
- [ ] Brief 15's stub regression check (the stub path's numbers against `lab15.baseline.stub`): blocked until both question files exist, the manifest is built and an instructor records the baselines
- [x] Rebuild the corpus snapshot from `31d5d92` (the merge of the last briefing edits): 13 pages, 684,704 characters, 186,495 `cl100k_base` tokens (was 544,974 and 147,738). The builder now drops each briefing's in-room timetable and the demos' Observable code and strips heading attributes, keeping the blank line after a heading; `tests/test_rag_questions.CleaningRules` covers each rule and checks the snapshot has no heading glued to its text. Labs 13, 14 and 15 re-pin the hash and were re-recorded on the build Mac (126 s, 233 s, 1,285 s); Module 13's cost and chunk figures and the data README follow. Status stays `provisional` until Romeo freezes it; the question sets are written only after that
- [ ] Find out why two cells of Lab 15 (the worked change and the share card) took about three times as long on the build Mac with the rebuilt snapshot (99 to 304 s, 67 to 295 s; the kernel waited on GPU synchronization), and whether the T4 path shows it. The 2026-10-08 batch, on the snapshot rebuilt from `05da486`, ran Lab 15 in 832 s end to end (against 776 s and 1,285 s on 2026-10-06), so the slowdown did not recur; the same batch ran Lab 7 in 590 s against 336 s, unexplained

### Repository review — October 8, 2026

- [x] Review text casing, editorial consistency, and learning clarity; save prioritized, source-grounded recommendations in [suggestions.md](suggestions.md). Suggestions are recorded, not implemented; this review did not execute notebooks or render the site.
- [x] Act on the first five suggestions (October 8, 2026):
  - Draw the 13 figures that Modules 9–15 specified only in comments (`scripts/make_figures_09_11.py`, `scripts/make_figures_12_15.py`). Module 11's two plots are recomputed with Lab 11's code (`images/11-calibration.json`), matching the recorded summary numbers. The system diagrams name the nodes and edges of the lab code and the exercise that writes each part.
  - Fix the stale and contradictory learner text in `notebooks.qmd` and the generated-cell guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Write the casing, spelling and terminology rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (first sentence case; changed to title case the same day, below). Make an American-spelling pass, guarded by `tests/test_style.py`.
  - State on each agenda that an exercise using a Reference section restates what it needs, with a pointer in Modules 1, 3 and 9.
  - Fix the arrowheads that a duplicate SVG id removed from `05-self-attention.svg`.
  - Not executed: no notebook was run. `quarto render`, the link check and the browser check were run.
- [x] Before freezing Workshop Lectures v1, rebuild it from a commit that includes the October 8 edits: rebuilt from `05da486` (13 pages, 703,608 characters, 191,544 `cl100k_base` tokens; 1,863 / 905 / 458 chunks at $L$ = 128 / 256 / 512, printed by Lab 13 on the build Mac). The builder reads `modules/` and drops the Agenda section and the generated lab task list. The hash is re-pinned in Labs 13–15, the question fixtures, `_variables.yml` and the data README; Module 13's token, cost and chunk figures follow. Status stays `provisional` until Romeo freezes it. **The source commit must reach `main` by a merge commit, not a squash**, or the byte-for-byte rebuild test loses its commit
- [x] Act on suggestions 1 (reversed to title case), 6 to 12, and prepare 13 (October 8, 2026). Details under each item in [suggestions.md](suggestions.md):
  - Title case (APA) for every title and heading: `_variables.yml`, the generators, about 620 headings in pages and notebooks, the navigation; `scripts/titlecase.py` and `tests/test_style.py`.
  - A reading guide under each agenda and a briefing-section column in each lab table, from a new `lab:` front-matter map (`scripts/live_plan.py`).
  - Comparison tables at the 4→5, 6→7, 9→10, 11→12 and 13→14 transitions; transfer questions T1–T15.
  - A glossary and notation index and a results worksheet with a CSV download, generated from `_glossary.yml` and `_worksheet.yml` by `scripts/learner_pages.py`; linked from every module, the References, Notebooks and teach pages, the day wrap-ups and the footer.
  - 47 folded hints and 255 rewritten checkpoint messages in Labs 1–15; the harness points at the hint and the summary cell says which path ran; Labs 8, 13 and 15 label the backend beside each headline number.
  - A pilot protocol and observation form in `pilot/`, prepared, not run.
  - Run: the full unit suite, ruff, both generators (no drift), `quarto render`, the link check and the browser check; every lab offline in worked, `--verify-checkpoints` and `--learner` modes; every changed checkpoint message against a deliberately wrong implementation; all 16 notebooks on the build Mac's open path with `--record` (on AC power). Not run: Colab, a T4, the keyed paths
- [x] Notation clashes the glossary found that the pages do not yet flag (the glossary's notation table explains each): $\tau$ (Module 2's subsampling threshold before Module 3's temperature), $o$ (context word, output gate, outcome), $U$ (Modules 2 and 3), $M$ (mask, merges, bins, chunks), Module 13's $G$, $J$ and $R$ against Modules 8–10, Module 7's A/B note omitting Module 5's attention matrix, Module 7's "batch size in words" against Module 3's $B$, and Module 11's table calling $\hat{p}$ "the confidence". Flagged on the pages (October 9, 2026): Module 3's clash callout covers $U$, $\tau$ and $o_t$; Module 6's table, and Modules 11 and 13's callouts, cover $M$; Module 7 covers $A$, Module 3's batch $B$ and its own beam-size sentence; Module 9 flags $R$ against Module 8; Module 11 flags $o$ and says that "confidence" there is $\hat{p}$ and that Module 12's `confidence` is $\kappa$; Module 13 covers $G$, $J$, $R$ and its RAG box's $z$ and $\eta$; Module 14 flags $o_t$, $a_t$ and $c_t$ and drops the unused outcome $o$ from its kept symbols. The glossary's notes on $C$ and $\kappa$, which still said Modules 8 and 12 did not flag them, are corrected. Workshop Lectures v1 is rebuilt from `2182ed1`, the commit with these flags (13 pages, 704,707 characters, 191,863 `cl100k_base` tokens; 1,867 / 907 / 459 chunks at $L$ = 128 / 256 / 512, printed by Lab 13). The hash is re-pinned in Labs 13–15, the question fixtures, `_variables.yml`, the builder and the data README, and Module 13's figures follow. Labs 13, 14 and 15 were re-recorded on the build Mac's open path (121 s, 236 s, 992 s; on battery power, so upper estimates). Status stays `provisional`. **`2182ed1` must reach `main` by a merge commit**, like `05da486` before it
- [ ] Module 6 quotes "1.548 tokens per word (measured)", which is in neither `data/baselines.json` nor `runs/`: record it or drop "measured"
- [ ] Two weak checkpoints found while writing messages: Lab 10 Checkpoint 5's `requires_grad` test cannot catch a missing detach (its inputs need no gradient), and the Lab 14 TODO 3 hint's re-invoke behavior was checked on langgraph 1.2.14, while the notebook pins 1.2.12
- [ ] The social preview card (`images/social-preview.png`) was rebuilt with the title-case subtitle; upload it in the repository settings
