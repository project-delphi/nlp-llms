A five-day workshop by Genial Labs on the path from traditional NLP to modern LLMs: n-grams, word vectors, attention, transformers, RLHF, RLCD and agents. Modules 1 to 14 are each a short briefing followed by a hands-on lab in Google Colab, and the capstone fills most of the last day with hands-on pair work. Module 0 is optional pre-work.

<!-- BEGIN status -->
> **As of 2026-10-08: not yet ready to teach.** 0 of 15 labs have run end to end, with their current code, on the Colab runtime they are designed for. 15 have run end to end on their real path elsewhere, on another machine or on the CI runner, and 0 more in part. On the GitHub CPU runner (newest run of each notebook, 2026-10-06), 16 of 16 notebooks passed; 9 of the passing runs used test doubles, which check that the code runs, not what the models do. 8 of 11 pieces of blocking work are open. See the [readiness page](https://project-delphi.github.io/nlp-llms/readiness.html).

## Who It Is For

Machine learning practitioners who are comfortable with Python, NumPy and basic ML, and have some PyTorch. API keys are optional: every lab that uses a commercial API also runs on a free open model.

<!-- BEGIN days -->
| Day | Theme | Modules |
|---|---|---|
| Before Day 1 | Pre-work (optional) | 0 |
| 1 | Foundations: From Counts to Attention | 1–4 |
| 2 | Transformers and Pretrained Models | 5–7 |
| 3 | Using and Aligning LLMs | 8–10 |
| 4 | Calibration, Decisions and Retrieval | 11–13 |
| 5 | Agents and the Capstone | 14–15 |

On Day 1, each module is 95 minutes: 45 minutes of briefing, then 50 of lab. On Days 2 to 5, each module is 120 minutes: 55 minutes of briefing, 55 of lab, then a 10-minute debrief. On Days 2 to 4 the second module breaks for lunch between its briefing and its lab. On Day 5, the capstone build runs on across lunch. The capstone (Module 15) has no briefing: it takes 11:30–12:25, 13:25–14:30 and 14:45–16:45 on Day 5. The [schedule](https://project-delphi.github.io/nlp-llms/schedule.html) has the times.
<!-- END days -->

## Run It Locally

You need [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) 1.6 or later and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
quarto preview                                  # live preview of the site
quarto render                                   # build the site into docs/
uv run --group notebooks jupyter lab            # work on the labs
```

## Regenerating the Derived Files

`_variables.yml` is the single source of truth for module titles, durations, objectives and URLs. After changing it, or after adding a notebook, run:

```bash
uv run --group site python scripts/gen_tables.py      # tables in _includes/ and this README
uv run --group site python scripts/gen_notebooks.py   # notebook header and footer cells
```

Checks:

```bash
uv run --group lint ruff check scripts tests data agents-intro
uv run --group test python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
uv run --group execute python scripts/test_notebooks.py   # run every notebook
quarto render && uv run --group site python scripts/check_links.py
```

To start a new lab from the template:

```bash
uv run --group site python scripts/new_notebook.py m03        # add --api for API labs
```

## How It Deploys

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` regenerates the derived files, fails if they differ from what is committed, lints, tests, renders the site and checks its links. On a push to `main`, or a manual run on `main`, it deploys the site to GitHub Pages at <https://project-delphi.github.io/nlp-llms/>. Pages must be set to deploy from GitHub Actions (Settings → Pages → Source). Forks skip the deploy job.

The same site is mirrored at <https://genial-labs-ai.github.io/nlp-llms/>. The repository `genial-labs-ai/nlp-llms` is a plain copy of this one, not a fork: its `.github/workflows/mirror.yml` fast-forwards `main` from here every four hours, or on a manual run, and then dispatches `publish.yml`, which renders with the `genial-labs` Quarto profile (`_quarto-genial-labs.yml`: the mirror's own `site-url`) and deploys. The mirror skips the notebook, browser and health jobs. Issues and pull requests go here, never to the mirror.

## Repository Layout

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `_variables.yml` | Single source of truth: modules, schedule, URLs, model IDs |
| `_quarto.yml`, `custom.scss`, `fonts/` | Site configuration and theme |
| `*.qmd`, `modules/` | Site pages; one module page per module |
| `notebooks/` | One Colab lab per module from 1 to 15, stored without outputs (Module 0 has none) |
| `agents-intro/` | Module 0 reference solutions for its two apps |
| `_includes/` | Generated tables. Do not edit by hand |
| `scripts/`, `tests/` | Generators, notebook runner, link check, tests |
| `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md` | The build plan and the rules for coding agents |
