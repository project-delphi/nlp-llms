Instructor page, rendered by Quarto. The briefing rows are generated: scripts/gen_tables.py writes
_includes/pace-NN.md from the live plan in each briefing's front matter (scripts/live_plan.py), so
change a briefing's minutes there, never here. Lab rows come from the minutes in each notebook's
exercise headings, which follow the "As built" sections of briefs/*.md. Debrief, retrieval-practice
and wrap-up rows follow the day pages (day-2.qmd to day-5.qmd) and the facilitator guide. The
capstone rows follow Module 15's timing. Module titles and slot lengths come from _variables.yml.

## How to Read This Sheet

{{< include /_includes/module-shape.md >}}

Each module has two tables. The first is the briefing's **live plan**, generated from the module page: minutes count from the start of the briefing, and "In the room" lists the checks, predictions and demos whose minutes the row includes. The second is the **lab**: minutes count from the start of the lab. "CP" is a checkpoint; Checkpoint *N* belongs to Exercise *N*. The last column says what participants should have passed by the end of that row. If more than a third of the room has not, apply the module's "behind" rule. A behind rule's minute is a lab minute unless it says briefing minute or build minute. Clock times are on the [schedule](schedule.qmd).

**Day 1:** the lab is the {{< var schedule.clocks.standard.shape.lab >}}-minute core path and ends the module. **Days 2 to 5:** the lab is {{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.lab >}} minutes: the same core path, with 5 minutes of slack for setup and downloads in its first row, so every later row starts 5 minutes later than the notebook's own minutes suggest. If setup goes quickly, the room runs ahead and keeps the minutes. The lab table ends with the {{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.debrief >}}-minute **debrief**: the Explain step, taken with the whole room. Each day also opens with a warm-up and closes with a wrap-up, both on the day pages. What to say in each debrief, and what to cut when a day's clock slips, are in the [facilitator guide](facilitator-guide.md#shape).

**These minutes are planning estimates.** **No lab has been timed on Colab or on a T4.** Labs 1 to 5 were timed on a shared CPU only, and Labs 2 to 5 took far longer there than these minutes allow (see the [facilitator guide](facilitator-guide.md)). The briefing plans were set on paper; no briefing has yet been given aloud against its clock (see the [readiness page](readiness.qmd#open-work)). Treat every row as a target until you have run the notebook on the room's runtime and given the briefing once.

Collapsed callouts marked **Optional**, sections marked **Reference**, and checks or demos that a live plan does not name sit outside the briefing minutes. The stretch section of every lab sits outside the lab minutes.

## Before Day 1: Module 0 · {{< var modules.m00.title >}}

Optional pre-work, planned at {{< var modules.m00.minutes >}} minutes, with no briefing; the same rows pace the optional drop-in clinic on Day 1, 08:00–09:00. Minutes count from the start. **Provisional:** these rows follow the step plan on the [Module 0 page](modules/00-coding-agents.qmd). No one has yet timed the module on a fresh laptop, so they are a target, not a measurement. Install failures and what to do about them are in the [facilitator guide](facilitator-guide.md#module-0).

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–10 | Install one coding agent, sign in, start it in `~/agent-apps` | the agent answers the sanity prompt and leaves the folder empty |
| 10–20 | Prompts: install git and `gh` if missing, git identity, `gh` sign-in in the browser, a public repository | `gh auth status` (run by the agent) shows the participant signed in; the repository's GitHub page shows the README |
| 20–38 | App 1 by prompts: protein structure explorer (1UBQ), its separate check, the fix, its three.js page | the check matches the page's numbers; `protein/` is committed |
| 38–55 | App 2 by prompts: RFM customer segmentation, its separate check and hand-computed recency, the fix, its three.js page | the check and the recency match; `rfm/` is committed |
| 55–60 | Publish by prompts: landing page, push, GitHub Pages on | both Pages URLs load (allow up to 10 minutes after enabling Pages) |

**Behind at minute 10:** if the agent is still not installed or signed in, pair the participant with a neighbor whose agent works. They take turns writing the prompts in the neighbor's repository, and the participant finishes their own install at home. **At 08:55:** everyone stops; the rest is homework.

## Day 1

**Behind at minute 28:** set `QUICK = True` before Exercise 4 (on by default on a CPU runtime); shorten Exercise 5.

### Module 6 · {{< var modules.m06.title >}}

**Briefing** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.briefing >}} minutes, before lunch)

{{< include /_includes/pace-06.md >}}

The briefing stops at lunch, wherever it has reached. On slow Wi-Fi, participants can open Lab 6, switch on a T4 and run the setup cell as they leave, so the checkpoints download over lunch.

**Lab** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.lab >}} minutes, after lunch) **and debrief** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.debrief >}})

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |

| 55–65 | **Debrief:** tokens per word; the encoder's test accuracy and macro-F1 beside Labs 1 and 2, by runtime; the misconception "a pretrained model always wins by a wide margin"; the bridge to Module 7 | the room's numbers on the board |

**Behind at minute 25:** run Exercise 2 as a demonstration; if still behind at minute 33, Exercise 3 too. Exercises 1, 4 and 5 may not be cut.

**Behind at minute 37:** run Exercise 6's `SAMPLING` cell as a demonstration and keep `rouge_n`. The stretch is the first thing dropped on any day.

### Day Wrap-Up

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | In pairs: the three prompts on the [Day 2 page](day-2.qmd#wrap-up) | |

| 53–55 | What the response did not tell you | |
| 55–65 | **Debrief:** per provider and path, schema-validity rate, exact match with its standard error, cost, latency; the misconception "structured output means correct output"; the bridge to Module 9 | the room's numbers on the board |

**Behind at minute 28:** let the evaluation run finish while participants write Exercise 3, which is where the notebook places it; the checkpoints use the `FakeProvider` and do not wait for it.

### Module 9 · {{< var modules.m09.title >}}

**Briefing** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.briefing >}} minutes, before lunch)

{{< include /_includes/pace-09.md >}}

| 49–55 | Exercise 5 (normalize and save) | CP5 |
| 55–65 | **Debrief:** gradient variance without and with the baseline; the reward model's held-out accuracy beside its ceiling; the misconception "a reward model should reach 100%"; the bridge to Module 10 | the room's numbers on the board |

**Behind at minute 29:** run Exercise 2's five-seed training as a demonstration. Part B (29–55) needs the Lab 9 data files; see the facilitator guide if they are missing.

|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | In pairs: the three prompts on the [Day 3 page](day-3.qmd#wrap-up) | |
| 5–15 | With the room: fixed and left open for Modules 8 to 10; today's rows of the running table; what the numbers do not say | today's rows on the board, kept for Day 5 |

## Day 4

### Warm-Up

| 8–18 | Exercise 1 (reliability bins and ECE) | CP1 |
| 18–25 | Exercise 2 (Brier score and log loss) | CP2 |
| 25–35 | Exercise 3 (temperature scaling) | CP3 |
| 35–47 | Exercise 4 (parse a stated confidence); start `ask_all` first | CP4 |
| 47–55 | Exercise 5 (risk–coverage and the threshold), ending with the closing question: what would you let act alone? | CP5 |
| 55–65 | **Debrief:** ECE, Brier score and log loss before and after temperature scaling, with accuracy unchanged; the stated confidence's ECE; the misconception "temperature scaling makes the model more accurate"; the closing question as the bridge to Module 12 | the room's numbers on the board |

**Timing:** the closing question is part of Exercise 5's 8 minutes. If the room is late, take it into the debrief as the bridge to Module 12, whose briefing follows the break. **Behind at minute 35:** start `ask_all` before discussing Exercise 3's results.

### Module 12 · {{< var modules.m12.title >}}

| 50–55 | What this lab showed and what it did not | |
| 55–65 | **Debrief:** accuracy, ECE and Brier score under the two rewards (our illustration); the thresholds and the cost per case; the misconception "Jev's `confidence` is the probability that its answer is right"; the bridge to Module 13 | the room's numbers on the board, each labeled with its path |

**Behind at minute 32:** shorten the Exercise 3 discussion. Never cut the closing cell (50–55): it carries the honesty rule.

| 55–65 | **Debrief:** recall@$k$ and MRR at the chosen $L$ and $k$, with and without reranking; faithfulness and the two-by-two table (plumbing probes until the question set exists); the misconception "a faithful answer is a correct answer"; the bridge to Module 14 | the room's numbers on the board |

**Behind at minute 34:** on the keyed Jev path, rerank `test` only.

### Day Wrap-Up

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5 | In pairs: the three prompts on the [Day 4 page](day-4.qmd#wrap-up) | |
| 5–13 | With the room: fixed and left open for Modules 11 to 13; today's rows of the running table; ranking or values | today's rows on the board, kept for Day 5 |

## Day 5

### Warm-Up

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–6 | Alone, on paper, notes closed: the five questions on the [Day 5 page](day-5.qmd#warm-up) | an answer to each question |
| 6–10 | Compare with a neighbor | |

### Module 14 · {{< var modules.m14.title >}}

**Briefing** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.briefing >}} minutes)

{{< include /_includes/pace-14.md >}}

Module 14 was the densest briefing in the desk timing of 2026-10-06, and its plan is checked on paper only. **Behind at briefing minute 38 (section 7 not yet started):** give section 9 as reading, as the briefing's live-plan note says; that recovers its 5 minutes, and the core lab does not depend on it.

**Lab** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.lab >}} minutes) **and debrief** ({{< var schedule.clocks.long.shape.debrief >}})

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–8 | Setup and Exercise 0 (read the graph); the lookalike-package warning again; the 5 minutes of slack | |
| 8–14 | Exercise 1 (a safe calculator) | CP1 |
| 14–26 | Exercise 2 (thresholds as edges) | CP2 |
| 26–34 | Exercise 3 (the human-in-the-loop driver) | CP3 |

| 41–51 | Exercise 5 (measure the agent) | CP5 |
| 51–55 | What this lab showed and what it did not | |
| 55–65 | **Debrief:** route accuracy; unsafe-action rate and injection success, each with its denominator, by path; the misconception "an unsafe-action rate of zero means the guard is safe"; the bridge to the capstone | the room's numbers on the board |

**Behind at minute 34:** on a CPU runtime, cut the probability-shift test to 30 items (slice the list in the evaluation-run cell).

### Module 15 · {{< var modules.m15.title >}}

{{< var modules.m15.minutes >}} minutes in the two module slots after Module 14, then the day's closing slot, where the wrap-up ends: 255 minutes in all. There is no briefing table and no lab table: the plan below follows [Module 15's timing](modules/15-capstone.qmd#timing) and the starter notebook, `15-capstone.ipynb`. The evaluation set does not exist yet, so the baseline and the comparison in this plan cannot be run as designed: see the [readiness page](readiness.qmd#open-work).

**Part I and Part II** (the middle slot: the brief, then 110 minutes of build across lunch). Build minutes count from the end of the brief, as in Module 15 and the notebook; lunch falls at build minute 45.

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| brief, 0–10 | Part I. The brief (briefing sections 1–4): a walk through the tables | pairs formed; path class chosen |
| build, 0–20 | Setup, self-test, write `after_verify`, baseline on `dev` then `test`, read ten traces | self-test green; both baselines run |
| build, 20–30 | Choose one component; fill in the hypothesis card | hypothesis card filled |
| build, 30–45 | Make the change; rerun the self-test after every edit; iterate on `dev` | self-test still green; the notebook saved to Drive |
| | Lunch | |
| build, 45–105 | Reconnect (if Colab reset the runtime, rerun the setup and the `dev` baseline first); continue the change | self-test still green |
| build, 105–110 | Freeze the configuration; do not run `test` | configuration frozen |

**At build minute 20:** check that every pair has a `dev` baseline and has read traces. **Behind at build minute 30:** any pair still without a `dev` baseline gets help before anyone else.

**Part III** (the afternoon slot, its first 105 minutes)

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–20 | Run `test` on the frozen system; run the last cell; hand in the file | submission handed in |
| 20–80 | Two-minute shares, in menu order, with questions after each group | |
| 80–105 | The combined table, read with the room; the three cautions read aloud | |

**More than 15 pairs:** group the shares by component, four minutes per group.

**Part IV. Wrap-Up** (30 minutes: the last 15 of the afternoon slot, then the day's closing slot)

| Minutes | Segment | By the end |
|---|---|---|
| 0–10 | Section 7, five days, one line of ideas, with the boards from Days 2 to 4 | the table complete, with the room's numbers |
| 10–18 | Section 8, an evaluation checklist for agentic systems | |
| 18–25 | Section 9, open problems | each pair has named one open problem and the measurement it would start with |
| 25–30 | Section 10, further study; close | |

### Day Wrap-Up

On Day 5 the day wrap-up is not a separate slot: it is the wrap-up's last 15 minutes, and the prompts on the [Day 5 page](day-5.qmd#wrap-up) run through the whole wrap-up. Item 1 (the whole line) is section 7's table. Item 2 (today's table) takes Lab 14's numbers from its debrief and the capstone's from Part III's combined table. Item 3 (what is still open) is section 9.
